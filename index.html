<h1 itemprop="headline name">Assault in Florida</h1>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/784.011">Florida Statute 784.011</a>, the crime of misdemeanor or simple assault is defined as an intentional and unlawful threat against another person, coupled with the apparent ability to carry out the threat, which creates a genuine and reasonable fear that violence or harm is imminent.</p>
<h3>Aggravated Assault</h3>
<p>If the Assualt is made with a deadly weapon (i.e. brandishing a weapon) or while committing a felony offense, the assault constitutes an <a href="#aggravated_assault">Aggravated Assault</a> and is prosecuted as a felony.</p>
<h3>Assault versus Attempted Battery</h3>
<p>Notably, an Assault is not the same thing as an Attempted Battery. An Assault is a threat to commit a violent act - an Attempted Battery is the actual commission of the violent act, albeit unsuccessfully.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Assault</h2>
<p>In Florida, the crime of simple Assault is a Second Degree Misdemeanor and punishable by up to sixty (60) days in jail, six (6) months of probation, and a $500 fine.</p>
<p>A judge may sentence a person convicted of simple Assault to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of sixty days in jail.</p>
<h3>Public Safety Reclassification</h3>
<p>Florida enhances the potential penalties for the crime of assault if the victim is one of the following types of public servants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency Medical Care Provider</li>
<li>Firefighter</li>
<li>Law Enforcement Officer</li>
</ul>
<p>If the victim falls into one of these categories, the assault charge if reclassified from a Second Degree Misdemeanor to a First Degree Misdemeanor.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Assault</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Assault are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#conditional-threat">Conditional Threat</a></li>
<li><a href="#idle-threat">Idle Threat</a></li>
<li><a href="#unreasonable-fear">Unreasonable Fear</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conditional-threat">Conditional Threat</h3>
<p>A statement that sets out a conditional threat to commit a violent act at some unspecified point in the future based upon a possible eventuality does not constitute an assault (although it could constitute another crime such as Disorderly Conduct). <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="idle-threat">Idle Threats</h3>
<p>A mere idle threat, unaccompanied by any physical act that justifies a belief that the person will actually follow through with the threat, does not constitute an assault. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="unreasonable-fear">Unreasonable Fear</h3>
<p>If, while being “threatened”, the accuser was taunting the defendant or did not actually believe the defendant would follow through with the threat, then a later claim of assault - usually because of pettiness - will be ruled unreasonable because the accuser did not actually feel threatened.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Battery Charges in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Florida enhances the penalties for certain types of battery crimes depending on the status of the victim.</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, Florida <a href="#reclassification">reclassifies</a> certain battery crimes depending on the status of the victim. If a battery is reclassified, a person is subject to a greater penalty.</p>
<h2 id="misdemeanor-battery">Misdemeanor Battery (Simple Battery)</h2>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/784.03">Florida Statute 784.03</a>, the crime of misdemeanor battery is committed when a person either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Intentionally touches or strikes another person against their will; or</li>
<li>Intentionally causes bodily harm to another person.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, a battery can occur from something minor, such as grabbing another person’s arm; or a battery could also occur by throwing something that strikes another person.</p>
<p>Importantly though, when it comes to touching or striking a person, there is no requirement that the person be injured  - the non-consensual contact is sufficient.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Battery</h2>
<p>The crime of Battery is a First Degree Misdemeanor and if convicted of Battery, a judge can impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to one (1) year in jail.</li>
<li>Up to one (1) year of probation.</li>
<li>Up to $1,000 in fines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reclassification">Reclassification of Battery Charge</h3>
<p>Florida reclassifies or upgrades the crime of battery if the battered person falls into one of the following categories and was engaged in the lawful performance of his or her duty when they were battered.</p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency Medical Care Provider: This category includes ambulance drivers, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, registered nurses, and physicians.</li>
<li>Firefighter: This category, while self explanatory, also includes any person who works for the state putting out fires.</li>
<li><a href="#battery_on_law_enforcement_officer">Law Enforcement Officer</a>: This category includes law enforcement officers, correctional officer, probation officers, federal law enforcement officers, and Fish and Wildlife Officers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the person you are accused of battering falls into one of these categories, the battery charge if reclassified as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery: Reclassified from a First Degree Misdemeanor to a Third Degree Felony.</li>
<li>Aggravated Battery: From a Second Degree Felony to a First Degree Felony. Additionally, any person convicted of aggravated battery of a law enforcement officer shall be sentenced to a minimum 5 years in prison.</li>

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/784.045">Florida Statute 784.045(1)(a)</a>, the crime of Aggravated Battery is defined as an intentional battery with a deadly weapon, intentionally causing great bodily harm, or <a href="#aggravated_battery_on_pregnant_person">battery against a pregnant person</a> and is punishable by up to fifteen years in prison.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Aggravated Battery</h2>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Aggravated Battery is a Second Degree Felony and punishable by up to fifteen (15) years in prison, fifteen (15) years of probation, and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Aggravated Battery is assigned a Level 7 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. Absent grounds for a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence, a judge is required to sentence a person convicted of Aggravated Battery to a minimum sentence of 21 months in prison, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of fifteen years in prison.</p>
<h3 id="10-20-Life">10-20-Life Firearm Enhancement</h3>
<p>Aggravated Battery with a Firearm is technically the same offense as Aggravated Battery with a Deadly Weapon.

<p>Under 10-20-Life, and depending on how the firearm was used, a person convicted of Aggravated Battery with a Firearm could receive one of the following mandatory-minimum prison sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimum 10 year prison term if in possession of a firearm;</li>
<li>A minimum 20 year prison term if the firearm was discharged; and</li>

<blockquote class="half">Florida enhances the penalties for certain types of battery crimes based on the status of the victim.</blockquote>
<p>Aggravated Battery on a Pregnant Person is a unique crime, because it is deemed an aggravated crime simply because of the condition of the victim, regardless of whether any injury was actually inflicted on the person. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>This unique nature can lead to absurd results; as simply grabbing a pregnant person’s arm can result in a 21 month prison sentence.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that a person charged with Aggravated Battery on a Pregnant Person should retain highly effective counsel.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Battery on a Law Enforcement Officer in Florida</h1>
<p>Florida vigorously prosecutes people alleged to have acted physically obstructed law enforcement officers and imposes heightened penalties on civilians who batter law enforcement officers while are carrying out their public duties.</p>
<blockquote class="half">The use of force to resist an arrest by a known law enforcement officer is unlawful.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/784.07">Florida Statute 784.07(2)(b)</a>, the crime of Battery on a Law Enforcement is defined as the touching or striking of a law enforcement officer engaged in the lawful execution of a legal duty.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Battery on a Law Enforcement Officer</h2>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Battery on a Law Enforcement Officer is a Third Degree Felony and punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Battery on a Law Enforcement Officer is assigned a Level 4 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge may sentence a person convicted of Battery on a Law Enforcement Officer to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of five years in prison. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Battery on a Law Enforcement Officer</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Battery on a Law Enforcement Officer are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#on-the-job">“On the Job”</a>,</li>
<li><a href="#self-defense">Self Defense</a>, or</li>
<li><a href="#unknown-status">Unknown Status</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="on-the-job">On The Job</h3>
<p>A conviction for Battery on a Law Enforcement Officer requires proof that the officer was “engaged in the performance of a lawful duty when the battery occurred,” not just “on the job.” <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>This requirement means that even if a uniformed law enforcement officer is working off duty for a bar, convenience store, as mall security, or for any private employer, they are merely “on the job” for the private employer and are not afforded enhanced protection under the statute if they should be struck while working for the private employer. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>However, if while working for a private employer, they become engaged in “activities of an official police nature,” such as breaking up a fight, escorting a trespasser of the premises, or arresting someone, a person who then batters the officer is subject to being convicted of Battery on a Law Enforcement Officer.</p>
<h3 id="self-defense">Self Defense</h3>
<p>The use of violence against an officer who is effectuating an arrest is unlawful regardless of whether the arrest is technically illegal.</p>
<p>However, apart from an arrest scenario, a person is authorized to use reasonable force to defend themselves against other unlawful actions committed by law enforcement officers. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<p>Examples of unlawful actions that a person may defend against are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlawfully entering a private home;</li>
<li>Unlawfully frisking a person; or</li>
<li>Unlawfully detaining someone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, regardless of whether an officer is engaged in unlawful activity, a person who uses force against an officer does so at his own risk; as the State Attorney’s Office will usually err on the side of the law enforcement officer when filing charges.</p>
<h4>Excessive Force</h4>
<p>If an officer uses excessive force when making an arrest, a person is justified in the use of reasonable force to defend himself or herself.</p>
<p>Additionally, the danger of excessive force or police brutality need not have been actual to justify a self-defense claim. In such instances, you are allowed to defend yourself if the appearance of excessive force or police brutality appeared to be imminent.</p>
<p>However, a person can only defend themselves to the extent reasonably believed that such force was necessary. And the determination of whether the resistance with violence was justified is based upon the circumstances at the time.</p>
<h3 id="unknown-status">Unknown Status</h3>
<p>While a person is not justified in using force to resist a police officer who is “known, or reasonably appears to be a law enforcement officer.” A person accused of Battery on Law Enforcement Officer must have reason to know that the “victim” was actually an officer and not someone impersonating an officer.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Domestic Battery by Strangulation in Florida</h1>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/784.041">Florida Statute 784.041(2)</a>, the crime of Domestic Battery by Strangulation is defined as knowingly and intentionally impeding the normal breathing or blood circulation of a family member, household member, or significant other by applying pressure on the throat or neck, or by blocking the nose or mouth, in a manner that creates a risk of, or actually causes, great bodily harm.</p>
<p>Domestic Battery by Strangulation is a politically charged topic in Florida and is prosecuted aggressively - usually by specially trained prosecutors.</p>
<p>Importantly, even though Domestic Battery by Strangulation cases are often the result of false accusations by spiteful partners, do not attempt to resolve a Domestic Battery by Strangulation case without an experienced attorney, because a conviction results in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mandatory Jail Time if injuries ocurred;</li>
<li>Permanent Criminal Record;</li>
<li>Treated as a Deportable Offense for Immigration Purposes;</li>
<li><a href="#criminal_post_conviction_sealing">Ineligible for Sealing or Expungement</a>, and</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Domestic Battery by Strangulation</h2>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Domestic Battery by Strangulation is a Third Degree Felony and punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Domestic Battery by Strangulation is assigned a Level 6 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge may sentence a person convicted of Domestic Battery by Strangulation to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of five years in prison.</p>
<h3>Collateral Consequences</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_sentencing_penalties">statutory penalties</a> applicable to any criminal offense, Domestic Battery by Strangulation charges also carry the following collateral consequences if convicted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mandatory completion of 29 Week Batterers Intervention Program;</li>
<li>Ineligible to ever be Sealed or Expunged from criminal record;</li>
<li>Forfeiture of right to have a gun while on probation, even for a misdemeanor; and</li>
<li>Revocation of any concealed weapons permit.</li>
</ul>

<p>A defendant can always pursue the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that are available in every criminal case.</p>
<p>However, defending Domestic Battery by Strangulation cases require a more nuanced approach, because deeper issues usually caused the altercation and allegations in the first place. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol, Drug, or Substance Abuse, </li>
<li>Child Custody Disputes, </li>
<li>Injunctions Proceedings,</li>
<li>Mental Health Issues</li>
<li>Pending Divorce, or</li>
<li>Spiteful Family Members.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these things in mind, the best way to approach a Domestic Battery by Strangulation case is to develop a plan that will not only result in the dismissal of the case, but also bring harmony between you and the accuser.</p>

<h3>Treatment and Counseling</h3>
<p>One of the first things I do when hired is recommend counseling pending resolution of the case.</p>
<p>This allows you to address underlying issues that caused the altercation and develop positive habits that will help you avoid future conflicts.</p>
<p>I find this important because if the underlying issues are not addressed, many people find themselves right back at square one, which is something that should be avoided.</p>
<h3>Victim Outreach</h3>
<p>The next thing I do is reach out to the accuser. Many times, I find the accuser regrets what has been set in motion and wishes to stop things before they spiral out of control.</p>
<p>If this is true, I may be able to direct them towards the appropriate parties to expedite the dismissal of the case.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, just because the accuser wants to “drop the charges,” under Florida law the victim cannot drop charges, only the State Attorney can.</p>

<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Domestic Violence Battery</h2>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Domestic Violence Battery is a First Degree Misdemeanor and punishable by up to one (1) year in jail, one (1) year of probation, and a $1,000 fine.</p>
<p>A judge must sentence a person convicted of Domestic Violence Battery to a minimum-term of one year of probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of one year in jail. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h3>Collateral Consequences</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_sentencing_penalties">statutory penalties</a> applicable to any First Degree Misdemeanor offense, a Domestic Battery conviction also results in the following penalties and collateral consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum Mandatory Five (5) days in jail if injury caused;</li>
<li>Mandatory completion of 29 Week Batterers Intervention Program;</li>
<li>Ineligible to ever have criminal record sealed or expunged;</li>
<li>Forfeiture of right to have a gun while on probation, even for a misdemeanor; and</li>
<li>Revocation of any concealed weapons permit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Domestic Violence Battery</h2>
<p>Defending domestic violence cases are difficult, because deeper issues usually caused the altercation in the first place. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol, Drug, or Substance Abuse,</li>
<li>Child Custody Disputes, </li>
<li>Injunctions Proceedings,</li>
<li>Mental Health Issues,</li>
<li>Pending Divorce, or</li>
<li>Spiteful Family Members.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these things in mind, the best way to approach a domestic violence case is to develop a plan that will not only result in the dismissal of the case, but also bring harmony between you and the accuser.</p>

<h3>Treatment and Counseling</h3>
<p>One of the first things I do when hired is recommend counseling pending resolution of the case.</p>
<p>This allows you to address underlying issues that caused the altercation and develop positive habits that will help you avoid future conflicts.</p>
<p>I find this important because if the underlying issues are not addressed, many people find themselves right back at square one, which is something that should be avoided.</p>
<h3>Victim Outreach</h3>
<p>The next thing I do is reach out to the accuser. Many times, I find the accuser regrets what has been set in motion and wishes to stop things before they spiral out of control.</p>
<p>If this is true, I may be able to direct them towards the appropriate parties to expedite the dismissal of the case. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, just because the accuser wants to “drop the charges,” under Florida law the victim cannot drop charges, only the State Attorney can.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Felony Battery in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Felony Battery is a Third Degree Felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison.</blockquote>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/784.041">Florida Statute 784.041(1)</a>, the crime of Felony Battery is defined as intentionally touching or striking another person against their will which causes great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement.</p>
<p>The primary distinction between <a href="#index">misdemeanor battery</a>, felony battery, and <a href="#aggravated_battery">aggravated battery</a> is in the amount of harm that is inflicted and the intent to inflict the harm.</p>
<p>While no injury is necessary for a <a href="#index">misdemeanor battery</a> to be committed; a significant injury must occur before Felony Battery can be charged.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You hit another person and knock him out. So long as he does not suffer any lasting effects, you have committed a misdemeanor battery. But if you hit another person and break his nose, you can be charged with felony battery. (However, if there is no lasting injury to the nose, an argument can be made that only a misdemeanor battery was committed.)</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Felony Battery</h2>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Felony Battery is a Third Degree Felony and punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Felony Battery is assigned a Level 6 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. Absent grounds for a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence, a judge is required to sentence a person convicted of Felony Battery to a minimum sentence of 19-36 months in prison, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of five years in prison.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Felony Battery</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Aggravated Battery on a Pregnant Person are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#consent">Consent</a>,</li>
<li><a href="#insufficient-intent">Insufficient Intent</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="#self-defense">Self Defense</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="consent">Consent</h3>
<p>Since an element of Felony Battery is that the contact was non-consensual, consent to the contact is an obvious defense. Other examples where consent would be applicable as a defense are athletic events.</p>
<h4>Mutual Combat</h4>
<p>While not sanctioned as a legal defense, mutual combat is a theory that can be argued to a jury as a sub-category of the defense of consent. Essentially, the theory goes, if two people mutually engage in a fight (usually a bar brawl) neither person should be able to complain of the ensuing contact.</p>
<h3 id="insufficient-intent">Insufficient Intent</h3>
<p>The intent to commit a battery is determined by the circumstances surrounding the touching or the striking of the victim. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small> As such, there are rare circumstances where intentional, non-consensual touching will not rise to the level of criminal battery. Reported examples of such insufficient intent are:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Assistance</strong>: If a person is attempting to assist a disabled or elderly person, even if the disabled or elderly person does not want assistance, and the assistance results in the person falling and injuring themselves, the act of touching the disabled or elderly person to assist them will not be considered criminal battery. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Throwing a Tantrum</strong>: If a child (or adult) throws a tantrum and inadvertently hits a person causing an injury, either by throwing an item or by flailing a body part around, the inadvertent contact will not be considered criminal battery because there was no specific intent to hit the person. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></blockquote>
<h3 id="self-defense">Self Defense</h3>
<p><a href="#criminal_defenses_self_defense">Self defense</a>, also known as the justified use of force, is a defense to the crime of Felony Battery so long as non-deadly force was used to defend yourself against the other person’s unlawful attack.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/810.02">Florida Statute 810.02</a>, the crime of Burglary is defined as unlawfully entering a dwelling, structure, or conveyance; or remaining inside a dwelling, structure, or conveyance surreptitiously; or remaining in a dwelling, structure, or conveyance after permission to remain has been withdrawn with the intent to commit a crime inside.</p>
<p>There are three categories of Burglaries in Florida:</p>

<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Burglary</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Burglary include:</p>
<h3>Bystander</h3>
<p>Frequently, when two people (usually juveniles) are walking, one of the people will spontaneously decide to engage in illegal activity, such as entering an abandoned home or a closed business. If caught, law enforcement will often charge the second person who stood by and watched the first person commit the illegal activity as an accomplice, assuming the second person was acting as a lookout.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, simply being present with the first person is insufficient to convict the second person with burglary or trespass unless the second person consciously did some act or said some word that incited, caused, assisted, or encouraged the first person to commit the illegal act. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h3>Consent</h3>
<p>Consent to enter is not an element of Burglary, but is an affirmative defense to the crime. A defendant has the burden to offer evidence of consent. But once evidence of consent is presented, the prosecutor must disprove the consent to enter the dwelling beyond a reasonable doubt. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>Consent is usually raised when there are multiple people who use the dwelling, one of whom gave you consent to enter or use the dwelling. Under such circumstances a defendant cannot be convicted of burglary of a dwelling just because the other people were unaware you were authorizes to enter or use the dwelling.</p>
<h3>Lack of Intent to Commit a Crime</h3>
<p>One of the elements necessary to support a conviction for Burglary is the intent to commit a crime inside. Usually this is proven by showing that a person entered the dwelling stealthily. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>However, if a person shows non-criminal reasons for entering the dwelling, such as to get out of the rain or to find a place to sleep, a person cannot be convicted of Burglary (although a conviction for <a href="#trespass_trespass_on_property">Trespass</a> may be proper).</p>
<h3>Open to the Public</h3>
<p>A subset of the consent defense, if a dwelling is “open to the public” a person by definition has consensually entered, no matter what the subjective intentions for entering are. As a result, the right to “remain inside” is implied unless the State has proof that the implied consent to “remain inside” was withdrawn. So if you commit a crime inside (such as theft or robbery) you cannot also be convicted of Burglary. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<h4>Off Limits or Employee Only Area</h4>
<p>The “Open to the Public” defense does not apply to an off limits or employee only area of a dwelling and a Burglary conviction will be upheld if such an area is entered. <small><a href="#references">[5]</a></small></p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Burglary of a Structure in Florida</h1>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/810.02">Florida Statute 810.02(4)(a)</a>, the crime of Burglary of a Structure is defined as unlawfully entering a structure, remaining inside a structure surreptitiously, or remaining in a structure after permission to remain has been withdrawn with the intent to commit a crime inside.</p>
<blockquote class="half">The crime of Burglary of an Occupied Structure is a Second Degree Felony.</blockquote>
<p>A structure is defined as a building of any kind, either temporary or permanent, which has a roof over it, together with the surrounding curtilage.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Burglary of a Structure</h2>
<p>The penalties for the crime of Burglary of a Structure are determined by whether the structure was <a href="#occupied">occupied</a> or <a href="#unoccupied">unoccupied</a> at the time of the burglary.</p>
<h3 id="unoccupied">Burglary of an Unoccupied Structure</h3>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Burglary of an Unoccupied Structure is a Third Degree Felony and punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Burglary of an Unoccupied Structure is assigned a Level 4 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge may sentence a person convicted of Burglary of an Unoccupied Structure to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of five years in prison.</p>
<h3 id="occupied">Burglary of an Occupied Structure</h3>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Burglary of an Occupied Structure is a Second Degree Felony and punishable by up to fifteen (15) years in prison, fifteen (15) years of probation, and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Burglary of an Occupied Structure is assigned a Level 6 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge may sentence a person convicted of Burglary of an Occupied Structure to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of fifteen years in prison.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Burglary of a Structure</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Burglary of a Structure include:</p>
<h3>Bystander</h3>
<p>Frequently, when two people (usually juveniles) are walking, one of the people will spontaneously decide to engage in illegal activity, such as entering an abandoned home or a closed business. If caught, law enforcement will often charge the second person who stood by and watched the first person commit the illegal activity as an accomplice, assuming the second person was acting as a lookout.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, simply being present with the first person is insufficient to convict the second person with burglary or trespass unless the second person consciously did some act or said some word that incited, caused, assisted, or encouraged the first person to commit the illegal act. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h3>Consent</h3>
<p>Consent to enter is not an element of Burglary of a Structure, but is an affirmative defense to the crime. A defendant has the burden to offer evidence of consent. But once evidence of consent is presented, the prosecutor must disprove the consent to enter the dwelling beyond a reasonable doubt. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>Consent is usually raised when there are multiple people who use the dwelling, one of whom gave you consent to enter or use the dwelling. Under such circumstances a defendant cannot be convicted of burglary of a dwelling just because the other people were unaware you were authorizes to enter or use the dwelling.</p>
<h3>Lack of Intent to Commit a Crime</h3>
<p>One of the elements necessary to support a conviction for Burglary of a Structure is the intent to commit a crime inside. Usually this is proven by showing that a person entered the dwelling stealthily. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>However, if a person shows non-criminal reasons for entering the dwelling, such as to get out of the rain or to find a place to sleep, a person cannot be convicted of Burglary of a Structure (although a conviction for <a href="#trespass_trespass_in_structure">Trespass in a Structure</a> may be proper).</p>
<h3>Open to the Public</h3>
<p>A subset of the consent defense, if a dwelling is “open to the public” a person by definition has consensually entered, no matter what the subjective intentions for entering are. As a result, the right to “remain inside” is implied unless the State has proof that the implied consent to “remain inside” was withdrawn. So if you commit a crime inside (such as theft or robbery) you cannot also be convicted of Burglary of a Structure. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<h4>Off Limits or Employee Only Area</h4>
<p>The “Open to the Public” defense does not apply to an off limits or employee only area of a dwelling and a Burglary of a Structure conviction will be upheld if such an area is entered. <small><a href="#references">[6]</a></small></p>

<p>What this means is that if you break into a car to steal it and are found to be in possession of a screwdriver, to convict you of Possession of Burglary Tools, the State must adduce testimony showing that you used, or actually intended to use, the screwdriver to enter the car; not that you intended to use the screwdriver to hot-wire the ignition.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/827.03">Florida Statute 827.03(2)(d)</a>, the crime of Child Neglect is defined as a caregiver neglecting a child in a willful or culpably negligent manner.</p>
<p>Child Neglect occurs when a caregiver fails to provide a child with the essential care, supervision, and services necessary to maintain the child’s physical and mental health, or fails to take reasonable steps to protect the child from abuse, neglect, or exploitation by another person.</p>
<blockquote class="half">Child Neglect may be based on repeated conduct or on a single incident.</blockquote>
<p>Child neglect may be based on repeated conduct or on a single incident or omission that results in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, serious physical or mental injury, or a substantial risk of death, to a child. Likewise, child neglect can be based on a caregiver’s failure to provide a reasonable effort to protect a child from abuse, neglect, or exploitation by another person.</p>
<p>A child is defined as any person under the age of 18 and a caregiver is defined as a parent, adult household member, or other person responsible for the child’s welfare, such as a teacher. <small>[<a href="#references">1</a>]</small></p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Child Neglect</h2>
<p>The penalties for Child Neglect are determined by whether the child neglect caused the child great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement.</p>
<h3>Child Neglect without Great Bodily Harm, Permanent Disability, or Permanent Disfigurement</h3>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Child Neglect without Great Bodily Harm, Permanent Disability, or Permanent Disfigurement is a Third Degree Felony punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Child Neglect without Great Bodily Harm, Permanent Disability, or Permanent Disfigurement is assigned a Level 6 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge may sentence a person convicted of Child Neglect to probation, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of five years in prison.</p>
<h3>Child Neglect Causing Great Bodily Harm, Permanent Disability, or Permanent Disfigurement</h3>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Child Neglect Causing Great Bodily Harm, Permanent Disability, or Permanent Disfigurement is a Second Degree Felony and punishable by up to fifteen (15) years in prison, fifteen (15) years of probation, and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Child Neglect Causing Great Bodily Harm, Permanent Disability, or Permanent Disfigurement is assigned a Level 7 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a> and scores between 4 and 40 victim injury points.</p>
<p>Absent grounds for a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence, a judge is required to sentence a person convicted of Child Neglect Causing Great Bodily Harm, Permanent Disability, or Permanent Disfigurement to a minimum sentence of 24-51 months in prison, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of 15 years in prison.</p>

<h3>Simple Neglect</h3>
<p>The degree of negligence required to sustain a conviction for Child Neglect is as high as that required for the imposition of punitive damages in a civil action; thus simple negligence will not support a Child Neglect conviction. <small>[<a href="#references">2</a>]</small></p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Failure to Report Child Abuse or Neglect in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">A mandatory reporter is defined as any person who knows or suspects child abuse occurred.</blockquote>
<p>Florida imposes a legal duty upon every person to report known or suspected acts of child abuse or neglect to authorities.</p>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/39.205">Florida Statute 39.205</a>, the crime of Failure to Report Child Abuse or Neglect occurs when a mandatory reporter knowingly and willfully fails to report known or suspected acts of child abuse, abandonment, or neglect to the <a href="https://reportabuse.dcf.state.fl.us/">Florida Abuse Hotline</a>.</p>
<h3>Mandatory Reporter</h3>
<p>A common misconception is that only health professionals, child welfare workers, and teachers are considered mandatory reporters of child abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>However, under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/39.201">Florida Statute 39.201(1)</a>, a mandatory reporter is defined as any person who knows, or has reasonable suspicion to believe, that a child has been abused, abandoned, or neglected by an adult responsible for the child’s welfare.</p>
<p>The only difference is that while every person is required to report known or suspected child abuse to the <a href="http://www.myflfamilies.com/service-programs/abuse-hotline/report-online">Florida Abuse Hotline</a>, a lay person is not required to provide their name when doing so, whereas a health professional, child welfare worker, or teacher is required to provide their name when making the report. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Failure to Report Child Abuse or Neglect</h2>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Failure to Report Child Abuse or Neglect is a Third Degree Felony and punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Failure to Report Child Abuse or Neglect is assigned a Level 1 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge may sentence a person convicted of Failure to Report Child Abuse or Neglect to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of five years in prison.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Failure to Report Child Abuse or Neglect</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Failure to Report Child Abuse or Neglect include:</p>
<h3>Lack of Reasonable Suspicion</h3>
<p>While a person has a mandatory duty to report known acts of child abuse or neglect, such as when a child specifically states they have been abused or neglected, a person is not required to report suspected acts of child abuse that are based solely on gossip, rumor, or speculation.</p>
<p>Rather, a person is only required to report suspected child abuse or neglect if reasonable suspicion exists to support the belief that abuse or neglect occurred.</p>
<h4>Reasonable Suspicion</h4>
<p>Reasonable suspicion in the context of Failure to Report Child Abuse or Neglect has not been specifically defined by Florida’s appellate courts, but there are numerous appellate decisions defining reasonable suspicion in general terms, which would likely be applied by the courts.</p>
<p>Under the general legal standard, reasonable suspicion would exist if a person knew of articulable and objective facts supporting a belief that abuse or neglect occurred. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>As a result, while a lay person may be allowed to accept an innocent explanation from a parent regarding a child’s injury; a doctor, child welfare worker, or teacher would not be allowed to accept an innocent explanation that conflicts with their specialized training in determining whether reasonable suspicion exists to believe the child was abused or neglected. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Leaving a Child Alone in a Car in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Leaving a Child Alone in a Car for longer than 15 minutes is a first degree misdemeanor.</blockquote>
<p>In Florida, it is a crime to leave a child in a car unattended or unsupervised for longer than 15 minutes or for any period of time that results in great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement to a child.</p>
<p>However, it is not unlawful to leave a child alone in a car for less than 15 minutes, provided the car is not running and the health of the child is not in danger.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition of Leaving a Child Alone in a Car</h2>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/316.6135">Florida Statute 316.6135</a>, the crime of Leaving a Child Alone in a Car occurs when a caregiver leaves a child younger than six-years old unattended or unsupervised in a car or motor vehicle for longer than 15 minutes.</p>
<p>A caregiver is defined as a parent, legal guardian, or other person responsible for a child younger.</p>
<p>Motor vehicle means a motorized vehicle that can be operated on the road, such as a truck, van, R.V., golf cart, ATV, or similar vehicles.</p>
<h3>Aggravating Factors</h3>
<p>Additionally, if a caregiver leaves a child unattended or unsupervised in a running car or motor vehicle for any period of time that results in great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement to the child, the crime is enhanced from a First Degree Misdemeanor to a Third Degree Felony.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Leaving a Child Alone in a Car</h2>
<h3>Leaving a Child Alone in a Car Longer than 15 minutes</h3>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Leaving a Child Alone in a Car Longer than 15 minutes is a First Degree Misdemeanor and punishable by up to one (1) year in jail, one (1) year of probation, and a $1,000 fine.</p>
<p>A judge may sentence a person convicted of Leaving a Child Alone in a Car Longer than 15 minutes to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of one year in jail.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Possession of Child Pornography in Florida</h1>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/827.071">Florida Statute 827.071(5)(a)</a>, the crime of Possession of Child Pornography is defined as knowingly possessing, controlling, or viewing child pornography.</p>
<p>Child pornography includes photographs, motion pictures, exhibitions, shows, representations, images, data files, computer depictions, or other presentations that includes any sexual conduct by a child.</p>
<h3>Sexual Conduct</h3>
<p>Sexual conduct includes both actual or simulated sexual activity, actual lewd exhibition of the genitals, and actual physical contact with a person’s clothed or unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or female breasts with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of either party.</p>
<h3>Unit of Prosecution</h3>
<p>Child pornography investigations usually result in the discovery of multiple images of child pornography. And while the term child pornography connotes the possession of multiple images, Florida law defines the possession of each image as a separate and distinct crime.</p>
<blockquote class="half">Florida law treats each image of child pornography as a separate crime. -- Florida Statute 827.071(5)(a)</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, each image of child pornography can be prosecuted as a separate count of Possession of Child Pornography. And most people arrested for Possession of Child Pornography are formally charged with 10s or 100s of counts of Possession of Child Pornography.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Possession of Child Pornography</h2>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Possession of Child Pornography is a Third Degree Felony and punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Possession of Child Pornography is assigned a Level 5 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge may sentence a person convicted of a single count of Possession of Child Pornography to sex offender probation, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of five years in prison.</p>
<h3>Possession of Four or More Images of Child Pornography</h3>
<p>A person charged with four or more counts of Possession of Child Pornography would score a mandatory prison sentence under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a> and, absent grounds for a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence, a judge is required to sentence a person convicted of four or more counts of Possession of Child Pornography to prison, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of 5 years in prison.</p>
<p>As a result, a person charged with four counts of Possession of Child Pornography would be facing a mandatory prison sentence of 12 months in prison and would be facing an additional 4 months in prison for each additional count of Possession of Child Pornography the person is convicted of (i.e. A person charged with five counts of Possession of Child Pornography would be facing 15 months in prison).</p>
<h3>Aggravated Possession of Child Pornography</h3>
<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/775.0847">Florida Statute 775.0847(2)</a>, the crime of Aggravated Possession of Child Pornography is committed if a person possesses 10 or more images of any form of child pornography and at least one of the images contains one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>A child who is younger than the age of 5;</li>
<li>Sadomasochistic abuse involving a child;</li>
<li>Sexual battery involving a child;</li>
<li>Sexual bestiality involving a child; or</li>
<li>Any movie involving a child, regardless of length and regardless of whether the movie contains sound.</li>
</ol>
<p>Aggravated Possession of Child Pornography is a Second Degree Felony and punishable by up to fifteen (15) years in prison, fifteen (15) years of probation, and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Aggravated Possession of Child Pornography is assigned a Level 6 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>, which standing alone technically allows a judge to sentence a person convicted of Aggravated Possession of Child Pornography to sex offender probation.</p>
<p>However, Aggravated Possession of Child Pornography is a derivative crime, meaning that it is based on ten images of Child Pornography, which are often charged as separate counts. As a result, a person can be convicted of both Possession of Child Pornography and Aggravated Child Pornography <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small>, which would call for a minimum sentence of approximately 41 months in prison.</p>
<h3>Sex Offender Designation</h3>
<p>A person convicted of Possession of Child Pornography would not only be placed on sex offender probation, but would also be designated a sexual offender. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>A designated sex offender is required to comply with sexual offender registration laws in Florida and throughout the United States for the remainder of their lives.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Possession of Child Pornography</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, a specific defense to the crime of Possession of Child Pornography is:</p>
<h3>Adult Depiction</h3>
<p>It is a defense to the crime of Possession of Child Pornography that the images in question are entirely of persons over the age of eighteen (18) years of age (i.e. adults), even if one or more of the persons depicted appear to be under the age of 18. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h3>Child Erotica</h3>
<p>Child pornography can be distinguished from child erotica which is defined as material that depicts “young children as sexual objects or in a sexually suggestive way,” but is not “sufficiently lascivious to meet the legal definition of sexually explicit conduct.” <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<p>It is a defense to the crime of Possession of Child Pornography if the images of the children depict erotica, as opposed to pornography.</p>
<h3>Transitory Possession</h3>
<p>The crime of Possession of Child Pornography requires a person to either knowingly possess or intentionally view child pornography.</p>
<p>In some cases, people are unwittingly sent an image of child pornography, but immediately delete the image once they realize the illicit nature of the image. However, a thumbnail image may still reside on the person’s electronic device or the image may still be in a memory cache even though the primary image was deleted.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the image was not intentionally viewed and any remaining thumbnail image or memory cache image was not knowingly possessed. Consequently, the transitory possession of an image under these circumstances would be a defense to the crime of Possession of Child Pornography.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sex in Florida</h1>
<p>The crime of Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sex (officially called Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sexual Conduct by Using a Computer) is intended to protect children against the trolling, by adults, of internet chat rooms for minors.</p>
<blockquote class="half">
				If convicted of Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sex, a judge is required to impose a minimum prison sentence of 21 months in prison.
				</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/847.0135">Florida Statute 847.0135(3)</a>, the crime of Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sex is defined as the use of an online service, internet service, or electronic device to seduce, solicit, lure, or entice a minor, or person believed to be a minor, to engage in unlawful sexual conduct.</p>
<h3>Electronic Devices</h3>
<p>In 2007 the Florida legislature added the term “electronic device capable of data storage or transmission” to the list of mediums that are illegal to use when soliciting a child. While this clearly encompasses modern Smart Phones, it is unclear if the term encompasses generic cellular phones that lack sophisticated functions.</p>
<h3>Undercover Law Enforcement Techniques</h3>
<p>Notably, it is not a defense to Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sex if the person posing as a child was actually an undercover law enforcement agent.</p>
<p>Common undercover techniques occur when a law enforcement agent either: (1) poses as a child, or the parent of a child; or (2) law enforcement engages in a bait-and-switch conversation.</p>
<h4>Police Posing as a Child or Parent of a Child</h4>
<p>This tactic was popularized by the Dateline NBC series “To Catch a Predator” with Chris Hansen and involves police routinely posing as underage children (or the parents of underage children) on popular internet sites such as AOL, Facebook, Yahoo, and Craigslist. <small>[<a href="#references">FN1</a>]</small></p>
<p>Importantly, the fact that an undercover operative or law enforcement officer was involved in the detection and investigation of the crime of Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sexual Conduct Using a Computer cannot be raised as a defense in a subsequent prosecution for the offense. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h4>The “Bait and Switch” Technique</h4>
<p>Initially, the undercover law enforcement agent proposes engaging in legal sexual behavior; the most common scenario being a single mother looking to meet an adult male interested in sexual activity.</p>
<p>However, the undercover agent quickly redirects the conversation from lawful sexual relations with the “mother” to unlawful sexual relations with the mother’s minor child (almost always 14 years of age).</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sex</h2>
<p>The crime of Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sex is a Second Degree Felony in Florida and punishable by up to fifteen (15) years in prison, fifteen (15) years of probation, and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sex is assigned a Level 7 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. Absent grounds for a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence, a judge is required to sentence a person convicted of Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sex to a minimum sentence of 21 months in prison, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of 15 years in prison.</p>
<h3>Multiple Charges for Single Episode</h3>
<p>Each separate use of a computer, online service, Internet service, or electronic device can be charged as a separate criminal offense.</p>
<p>This means that if you use a computer on four separate occasions to discuss engaging in unlawful sex with the person believed to be a minor, you can be charged with four separate counts of Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sexual Conduct Using a Computer.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sex</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sexual Conduct Using a Computer are:</p>
<h3>Entrapment</h3>
<p>Entrapment occurs when an agent of the government induces a person to commit a crime that the person was not otherwise predisposed to commit.</p>
<p>In most prosecutions where the “Bait &amp; Switch“ technique is used to charge a defendant with the crime of Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sexual Conduct Using a Computer, the inducement by the government agent will not be in question; it is the predisposition of the defendant that will be the issue.</p>
<p>In determining whether the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime of Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sexual Conduct Using a Computer, we would need to closely examine the following issues to see if an Entrapment Defense might be viable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who initiated the discussions of unlawful sexual activity;</li>
<li>Persistence of law enforcement to commit the unlawful sexual act;</li>
<li>Documented instances of reluctance by the defendant to commit the unlawful sexual act; and</li>
<li>Defendant’s expressed sexual interests.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lack of Seduction, Solicitation, Luring, or Enticement</h3>
<p>A fundamental element of the crime of Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sexual Conduct Using a Computer is that the defendant either seduce, solicit, lure, or entice the child (or person believed to be a child) to engage in an unlawful sexual act.</p>
<p>However, each word has a very specific legal meaning and if the defendant did not actually engage in acts that would constitute seduction, soliciting, luring, or enticement; then the person cannot be convicted of the crime.</p>
<p>This defense is most viable in “Bait &amp; Switch“ prosecutions where the undercover law enforcement agent directs the entire conversation and the defendant merely acquiesces to the proposals.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors is a Third Degree Felony.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/847.0138">Florida Statute 847.0138</a>, the crime of Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors is defined as electronically transmitting harmful material to a person known or believed to be a minor.</p>
<h3>Harmful Material</h3>
<p>Harmful material is defined as any form of content, whether photographic or written, that depicts nudity or sexual content that primarily appeals to a prurient, shameful, or morbid interest that is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable material or conduct for minors and is without serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h3>Electronic Transmission</h3>
<p>While the statute criminalizing transmission of material harmful to minors states that the material must be sent by “Electronic Mail”, the Florida Supreme Courts has defined “electronic mail” to include both traditional email and electronic mail sent by instant messaging. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h3>Unit of Prosecution</h3>
<p>Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors investigations frequently result in the discovery of multiple images of harmful material being transmitted. And while the word “material” is commonly interpreted to encompass multiple items, Florida law defines each image of harmful material as a separate and distinct crime even if multiple items are attached to a single email.</p>
<p>Consequently, each piece of harmful material that is transmitted can be prosecuted as a separate count of Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors</h2>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors is a Third Degree Felony and punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors is assigned a Level 5 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge may sentence a person convicted of a single count of Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors to sex offender probation, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of five years in prison.</p>
<h3>Four or More Counts of Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors</h3>
<p>A person charged with four or more counts of Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors would score a mandatory prison sentence under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a> and, absent grounds for a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence, a judge is required to sentence a person convicted of four or more counts of Possession of Child Pornography to prison, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of 5 years in prison for each count.</p>
<p>As a result, a person charged with four counts of Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors would be facing a mandatory prison sentence of 12 months in prison and would be facing an additional 4 months in prison for each additional count of Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors the person is convicted of (i.e. A person charged with five counts of Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors would be facing 15 months in prison).</p>
<h3>Sex Offender Designation</h3>
<p>A person convicted of Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors would not only be placed on sex offender probation, but would also be designated a sexual offender. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>

<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, a specific defense to the crime of Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors is:</p>
<h3>Entrapment</h3>
<p>Entrapment occurs when an agent of the government induces a person to commit a crime that the person was not otherwise predisposed to commit.</p>
<p>In many cases charging Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors, a law enforcement officer will engage in a “Bait &amp; Switch“ where they will first say they are an adult but later claim they are actually a minor while trying to induce a person to send obscene material considered harmful to minors.</p>
<p>In most prosecutions where the “Bait &amp; Switch“ technique is used, the inducement by the government agent will not be in question, rather it will be the predisposition of the defendant to send harmful material to a minor that will be in question.</p>
<p>In determining whether the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime of Transmission of Material Harmful to Minors, the following issues would need to be developed to present a viable Entrapment defense:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who initiated or requested transmission of the harmful material;</li>
<li>How persistent was law enforcement in requesting the harmful material;</li>
<li>Has the defendant ever engaged in similar behavior; and</li>
<li>Did the defendant actively express interest in sending the harmful material.</li>
</ul>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Traveling to Meet a Minor in Florida</h1>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/847.0135">Florida Statute 847.0135(4)</a>, the crime of Traveling to Meet a Minor for Unlawful Sex is defined as traveling any distance within, from, or to Florida for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual conduct with a child after having used an online service or electronic device to seduce, solicit, lure, or entice the child to engage in unlawful sexual conduct. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<blockquote class="half">
				If convicted of Traveling to Meet a Minor, a judge is required to impose a minimum prison sentence of 21 months in prison.
				</blockquote>
<p>The crime of Traveling to Meet a Minor to Commit an Unlawful Sex Act is routinely charged alongside the crime of <a href="#soliciting_child_for_unlawful_sex">Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sex through a Computer</a>.</p>
<h3>Undercover Law Enforcement Techniques</h3>
<p>Notably, it is not a defense to Traveling to Meet a Minor to Commit Unlawful Sex if the person posing as a child was actually an undercover law enforcement agent. Common undercover techniques occur when a law enforcement agent either: (1) poses as a child, or the parent of a child; or (2) law enforcement engages in a bait-and-switch conversation.</p>
<h4>Police Posing as a Child or Parent of a Child</h4>
<p>This tactic was popularized by the Dateline NBC series “To Catch a Predator” with Chris Hansen and involves police routinely posing as underage children (or the parents of underage children) on popular internet sites such as AOL, Facebook, Yahoo, and Craigslist. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>Importantly, the fact that an undercover operative or law enforcement officer was involved in the detection and investigation of the crime of Soliciting a Child for Unlawful Sexual Conduct Using a Computer cannot be raised as a defense in a subsequent prosecution for the offense. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h4>The “Bait and Switch” Technique</h4>
<p>Initially, the undercover law enforcement agent proposes engaging in legal sexual behavior; the most common scenario being a single mother looking to meet an adult male interested in sexual activity.</p>
<p>However, the undercover agent quickly redirects the conversation from lawful sexual relations with the “mother” to unlawful sexual relations with the mother’s minor child (almost always 14 years of age).</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Traveling to Meet a Minor</h2>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Traveling to Meet a Minor for Unlawful Sex is a Second Degree Felony and punishable by up to fifteen (15) years in prison, fifteen (15) years of probation, and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Traveling to Meet a Minor for Unlawful Sex is assigned a Level 7 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. Absent grounds for a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence, a judge is required to sentence a person convicted of Traveling to Meet a Minor for Unlawful Sex to a minimum sentence of 21 months in prison.</p>
<h3>Multiple Charges for Single Episode</h3>
<p>Each separate use of a computer, online service, Internet service, or electronic device can be charged as a separate criminal offense.</p>
<p>This means that if you use a computer on four separate occasions to discuss engaging in unlawful sex with a person believed to be a minor, you can be charged with four separate counts of Traveling to Meet a Minor to Commit an Unlawful Sex Act.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Traveling to Meet a Minor</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Traveling to Meet a Minor are:</p>
<h3>Entrapment</h3>
<p>Entrapment occurs when an agent of the government induces a person to commit a crime that the person was not otherwise predisposed to commit.</p>
<p>In most prosecutions where the “Bait &amp; Switch“ technique is used to charge a defendant with the crime of Traveling to Meet a Minor to Commit an Unlawful Sex Act, the inducement by the government agent will not be in question; it is the predisposition of the defendant that will be the issue.</p>
<p>In determining whether the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime of Traveling to Meet a Minor to Commit an Unlawful Sex Act, we would need to closely examine the following issues to see if an Entrapment Defense might be viable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who initiated the discussions of unlawful sexual acts;</li>
<li>Persistence of law enforcement to commit the unlawful sexual act;</li>
<li>Documented instances of reluctance by the defendant to commit the unlawful sexual act; and</li>
<li>Defendant’s expressed sexual interests.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lack of Seduction, Solicitation, Luring, or Enticement</h3>
<p>A fundamental element of the crime of Traveling to Meet a Minor to Commit an Unlawful Sex Act is that the defendant either seduce, solicit, lure, or entice the child or person believed to be a child to engage in an unlawful sexual act.</p>
<p>However, each word has a very specific legal meaning and if the defendant did not actually engage in acts that would constitute seduction, soliciting, luring, or enticement; then the person cannot be convicted of the crime.</p>
<p>This defense is most viable in “Bait &amp; Switch“ prosecutions where the undercover law enforcement agent directs the entire conversation and the defendant merely acquiesces to the proposals.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Unlawful Installation of Tracking Device or Application in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">It is unlawful to install a tracking device or tracking software without consent.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/934.425">Florida Statute 934.425</a>, the crime of Unlawful Installation of a Tracking Device or Tracking Application occurs when a person installs a tracking device or tracking software application on another person's property without that person’s consent.</p>
<h3>Revocation of Consent</h3>
<p>A person may revoke their consent to the installation of the tracking device or tracking software application at any time.</p>
<p>Consent to the installation of the tracking device or tracking software application is presumed revoked by operation of law should one of the parties file for divorce or an injunction against the other person. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h3>Installation vs. Tracking</h3>
<p>Notably, because the statute is poorly written, it is only unlawful to <strong>install</strong> a tracking device or tracking software application on another person's property without consent.</p>
<p>Because the statute does not actually make it unlawful to <strong>track</strong> another person without their consent, even if they previously consented to the installation but later revoked their consent. Any such prosecution should be challenged as being unconstitutional under the <a href="#void-for-vagueness">void for vagueness</a> doctrine</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Unlawful Installation of Tracking Device or Application</h2>
<p>The crime of Unlawful Installation of Tracking Device or Tracking Application is a Second Degree Misdemeanor punishable by up to sixty (60) days in jail, six (6) months of probation, and a $500 fine.</p>
<p>A judge may sentence a person convicted of Unlawful Installation of Tracking Device or Tracking Application to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of sixty days in jail.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Unlawful Installation of Tracking Device or Application</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Unlawful Installation of Tracking Device or Application include:</p>
<h3>Legitimate Business Purpose Exception</h3>
<p>A person acting in good faith on behalf of a business entity may install a tracking device or tracking software application for a legitimate business purpose. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>Examples of a legitimate business purpose would be the installation of internet tracking cookies, GPS tracking software on electronics, or GPS tracking devices on business vehicles.</p>
<h3>Motor Vehicle Owner Exception</h3>
<p>The owner or lessee of a motor vehicle is not required to obtain consent before installing a tracking device or tracking software application on a vehicle they own or lease during their period of ownership. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="void-for-vagueness">Void for Vagueness</h3>
<p>Any criminal statute can be challenged as void for vagueness when it fails to give adequate notice of what conduct is prohibited because of its imprecision, thus inviting arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<p>As currently written, section <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/934.425">934.425</a> only applies to the initial installation of the tracking device or tracking application. However, the statute does not address when a person must remove the tracking device or tracking software, whether a person must stop tracking another person if consent to installation is revoked, or whether a person can continue tracking someone that has filed for divorce or an injunction.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it does not take much imagination to see a person being arrested or prosecuted for refusing to remove a tracking device or tracking software or continuing to track someone even though one of the parties filed for divorce or an injunction.</p>
<p>In such prosecution, a person should move to dismiss the charges arguing that the statute does not specifically prohibit such activities and to the extent the statute was intended to prohibit such activities, it is void for vagueness and unconstitutional.</p>

<h3>Misdemeanor Facilitation</h3>

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/893.13">Florida Statute 893.13(1)(A)(2)</a>, the crime of Cultivation of Cannabis is committed when a person grows or cultivates cannabis plants for personal use.</p>
<h3>Personal Use Threshold</h3>
<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/893.1351">Florida Statute 893.1351(4)</a>, possession of less than 25 cannabis plants is assumed to be for personal use absent additional evidence to suggest it was intended for sale or distribution.</p>
<p>However, possession of 25 or more cannabis plants constitutes prima facie evidence that the cannabis is intended for <a href="#sale_or_delivery_of_cannabis">sale or distribution of cannabis</a>.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Cultivation of Cannabis</h2>

<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Cultivation of Cannabis</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Cultivation of Cannabis are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</a></li>
<li><a href="#illegal-search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</a></li>
<li><a href="#lack-of-knowledge">Lack of Knowledge</a></li>
<li><a href="#medical-necessity">Medical Necessity</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h3>
<p>If the cannabis was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have to comply with the law of constructive possession, which requires the prosecutor to prove the following two elements to convict a person of Cultivation of Cannabis: <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the Cannabis' presence; and</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the cannabis, which means more than the mere ability to reach out and touch the cannabis. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it can be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive Cultivation of Cannabis.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You are living with a roommate who, unbeknownst to you, is growing multiple cannabis plants in his closet. Law enforcement find out about the plants, obtain a search warrant, search the house, find the cannabis plants, and arrest both you and your roommate. The prosecution should be unable to convict you of Cultivation of Cannabis because you were unaware that your roommate was cultivating cannabis in his closet.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Your roommate is growing multiple cannabis plants in his closet. Law enforcement find out about the plants, obtain a search warrant, search the house, find the plants, and arrest both you and your roommate. The prosecution should be unable to convict you of Cultivation of Cannabis because, even though you may have known the cannabis was in your roommate’s room, your roommate is the only person who exercised dominion and control over the plants.</blockquote>
<h3 id="illegal-search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>More often than not, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search; or they may coerce a person into agreeing to a search. If we can prove that either instance occurred, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained.</p>
<p>Other suppression possibilities that may present themselves are: if law enforcement obtained a search warrant in bad faith or if you were arrested without probable cause.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-knowledge">Lack of Knowledge</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative defense to the crime of Cultivation of Cannabis if you can prove that you did not know the plants you were growing were cannabis plants. Because knowledge is an affirmative defense, you would be required to testify a lack of knowledge of the substance’s illegal nature. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="medical-necessity">Medical Necessity</h3>
<p>The defense of medical necessity can be used when a person suffers from a physical illness or ailment for which there was no lawful medication available to properly treat the illness or ailment and cannabis was the only substance that could relieve the pain or suffering of the person. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>

<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/322.055">Florida Statute 322.055</a>, any person convicted of Importation of Cannabis will have their driver’s license or driving privilege suspended for six months by the Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr>.</p>

<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Importation of Cannabis are:</p>

<li><a href="#illegal-search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</a></li>
<li><a href="#lack-of-knowledge">Lack of Knowledge</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h3>
<p>If the cannabis was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have to comply with the law of constructive possession, which requires the prosecutor to prove the following two elements before you can be convicted of Importation of Cannabis: <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the Cannabis' presence; and</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the cannabis, which means more than the mere ability to reach out and touch the cannabis. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it can be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive Importation of Cannabis.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You sign for a package on behalf of a friend and, unbeknown to you, the package contained cannabis. The prosecution should unable to convict you of Importation of Cannabis unless they had some proof that you knew the cannabis was present.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Your roommate has cannabis shipped to the house, law enforcement intercept the package, but still deliver it to the house and your roommate accepts it. They then search the house after it is delivered. They should be unable to convict you of Importation of Cannabis because even though you may have known the cannabis was there, your friend is the only person who exercised dominion and control over the package.</blockquote>
<h3 id="illegal-search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>More often than not, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search; or they may coerce a person into agreeing to a search. If we can prove that either instance occurred, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained.</p>
<p>Other suppression possibilities that may present themselves are: if law enforcement obtained a search warrant in bad faith or if you were arrested without probable cause.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-knowledge">Lack of Knowledge</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative defense to the crime of Importation of Cannabis if you can prove that you did not know the substance in your possession was cannabis. Because knowledge is an affirmative defense, you would be required to testify a lack of knowledge of the substance’s illegal nature. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>A typical example would be if you signed for a delivery on behalf of a friend and, unbeknown to you, the package contained cannabis. In such a case, absent an admission, the prosecutor would likely be unable to prove that you imported the cannabis.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Possession of Controlled Substance in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Today when a person gets arrested for a drug offense there are more ways to resolve the case than in the past.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Florida regulates and criminalizes the simple possession of numerous narcotic and pharmacological drugs. These substances are generally referred to as Controlled Substances.</p>
<p>Some of the most commonly charged crimes involving the illegal possession of Controlled Substances are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#possession_of_cocaine">Possession of Cocaine</a></li>
<li><a href="#possession_of_fentanyl">Possession of Fentanyl</a></li>

<li><a href="#possession_of_synthetic_drugs">Possession of Synthetic Drugs</a></li>
<li><a href="#possession_of_alprazolam">Possession of Xanax (Alprazolam)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Being arrested for drug possession does not necessarily mean you will be labeled a criminal. The Florida Legislature has established several <a href="#Options">options for resolving drug possession cases</a> to help Floridians address substance abuse problems. Thus there are creative ways to resolve drug possession cases. </p>
<p>Unfortunately though, the opportunities available to resolve a simple drug possession case depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The nature of the charge.</li>
<li>Your prior criminal history.</li>
<li>The available substance abuse treatment programs.</li>
<li>Your attorney’s knowledge of the available <a href="#Options">options</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Options">Options for Resolving Drug Possession Cases</h2>
<p>Resolving a drug possession case is determined by evaluating:</p>
<ol>
<li>The person’s needs,</li>
<li>The specific laws which apply to the charge(s), and</li>
<li>The person’s guilt or innocence.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Central Florida, there are several sentencing alternatives available to a person accused of a drug possession charge. Each is briefly discussed below. </p>
<h3>Pretrial Diversion</h3>
<p>Pretrial Diversion is a program run by the State Attorney’s Office and is usually reserved for first time, nonviolent offenders.</p>
<p>The program is similar to probation, in that once you are accepted, you must report monthly to a supervising officer, undergo random drug testing, complete community service hours, and refrain any criminal activity. </p>
<p>The charges are dropped upon successful completion of Pretrial Diversion.</p>
<h3>Pretrial Intervention</h3>
<p>Pretrial Intervention is similar to Pretrial Diversion, but is run by the Court and is more lenient because a person does not have to have a spotless record. </p>
<p>Also similar to probation, you must report to the Court on a regular basis, submit to a drug evaluation and participate in drug treatment, comply with any specific requirements ordered by the Court, and refrain from being involved in any criminal activity. </p>
<p>Importantly, many Judges do not participate in Pretrial Intervention. As a result it is important that you hire an attorney who is familiar with the individual Judges and who can advise you accordingly. </p>
<p>Your charges will be dropped upon successful completion of Pretrial Intervention.</p>
<h3>Drug Court</h3>
<p>Drug Court is a diversionary program created to address the issue of repeat drug offenders. The program provides for the identification, evaluation, case management and placement of substance abusing offenders in order to avoid entering the formal criminal justice system. </p>
<p>The Drug Court Judge reviews progress reports on each participant. Incidents of noncompliance are reported immediately to the Drug Court Judge, along with recommendations as to consequences to be imposed. Upon successful completion of Drug Court your charges will be dropped.</p>
<h3>Motion to Suppress</h3>
<p>A Motion to Suppress seeks to have evidence excluded because it was illegally obtained. </p>
<p>Drug arrests are ripe with possibilities for filing a Motion to Suppress because drug arrests are usually based on police hunches, prolonged (and thus illegal) encounters, and unreliable information. </p>
<p>It is impossible to adequately explain the various reasons for filing a Motion to Suppress, however, before considering any of the sentencing alternatives described here, an attorney must analyze your particular facts to determine if a Motion to Suppress would resolve the case and result in your case’s dismissal.</p>
<h3>Plea</h3>
<p>Many people are uninterested in drug treatment and would rather resolve the case with as little supervision as possible. </p>
<p>For these people, the best resolution is to negotiate a minimal probation without drug treatment or testing. </p>
<p>However, it should be noted that Central Florida Judges generally impose random drug testing as a standard condition of probation. As a result, I strongly urge you to consider the previously mentioned options.</p>
<h3>Trial</h3>
<p>Not all people arrested for drug offense are guilty and many times a trial to determine one’s guilt or innocence is the best method to resolve the case.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Possession of Xanax in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Florida law requires that your driver license be suspended for two years upon conviction.</blockquote>
<p>In Florida, Xanax, the trade name for Alprazolam, is a Schedule IV controlled substance and it is a Third Degree Felony to possess any amount of Xanax without a prescription.</p>
<p>As a Schedule IV controlled substance, Xanax is considered to have a low potential for abuse and is currently accepted for medical use in treatment in Florida and the United States.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Xanax Possession</h2>
<p>In Florida, the crime of Possession of Xanax is a Third Degree Felony and punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Possession of Xanax is assigned a Level 3 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a> and a judge may sentence a person convicted of Possession of Xanax to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of five years in prison.</p>
<h3 id="driver-license-suspension">Driver License Suspension</h3>
<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/322.055">Florida Statute 322.055</a>, any person convicted of Possession of Xanax will have their driver’s license or driving privilege suspended for six months by the Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr>.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Xanax Possession</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific or common defenses to the crime of Possession of Xanax are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</a></li>
<li><a href="#expiration-date">Expiration Date</a></li>
<li><a href="#illegal-search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</a></li>

<li><a href="#overdose-defense">Overdose Defense</a></li>
<li><a href="#prescription-defense">Prescription Defense</a></li>
<li><a href="#temporary-possession">Temporary Possession</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h3>
<p>If the Xanax was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have to comply with the law of constructive possession, which requires the prosecutor to prove the following two elements before you can be convicted of Possession of Xanax: <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the Xanax’s presence; and</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the Xanax, which means more than the mere ability to reach out and touch the Xanax. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it can be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive Possession of Xanax.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police find Xanax in the glove box, they would be unable to convict you of Possession of Xanax unless they had some proof that you knew the Xanax was present.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend takes a bag of Xanax and places it at his feet. The police then stop you, see your friend’s bag, and arrest both of you. They should be unable to convict you of Possession of Xanax because even though you knew the Xanax was present, your friend is the only person who exercised dominion and control over it.</blockquote>
<h3 id="expiration-date">Expired Prescription Drugs</h3>
<p>Contrary to popular opinion, it is not illegal to possess expired alprazolam as long it was originally prescribed to you.</p>
<p>All the expiration date reflects is the final day that the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a medication. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>However, studies have shown that most prescription and over-the-counter drugs are perfectly good to use up to 15 years after the expiration date. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="illegal-search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>More often than not, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search; or they may coerce a person into agreeing to a search. If we can prove that either instance occurred, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained.</p>
<p>Other suppression possibilities that may present themselves are: if law enforcement obtained a search warrant in bad faith or if you were arrested without probable cause.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-knowledge">Lack of Knowledge</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative defense to the crime of Possession of Xanax if you can prove that you did not know the substance in your possession was Xanax. Importantly, this defense requires you to testify to your lack of knowledge of the substance’s illegal nature. <small><a href="#references">[5]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="legal-disposal">Legal Disposal Defense</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative  defense to the charge of Possession of Xanax for a person to briefly possess Xanax without a prescription for the sole purpose of legally disposing of it. <small><a href="#references">[6]</a></small></p>
<p>In order to raise a legal disposal defense, the Xanax must have been acquired without an unlawful intent, possessed for a brief period of time, solely for the purpose of disposing of the Xanax without delay.</p>
<h3 id="overdose-defense">Overdose Defense</h3>
<p>Any person who is experiencing a drug-related overdose and needs medical assistance, or a person assisting the person that needs medical assistance, is immune from prosecution for Possession of Xanax if it can be shown the evidence was obtained as a result of the overdose and need for medical assistance. <small><a href="#references">[7]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="prescription-defense">Prescription Defense</h3>
<p>While it seems obvious, many people are arrested for Possession of Xanax when they are unable to produce a valid prescription or a recently dispensed pill bottle. These arrests usually occur when law enforcement have stopped you for suspicious behavior and discover the Xanax in an unconventional container.</p>
<p>However, if either a valid Xanax prescription can be produced that pre-dated the arrest or a doctor executes a letter that they dispensed a sample amount, you will have an absolute defense to the Xanax charge. <small><a href="#references">[8]</a></small></p>
<p>Importantly, the Prescription Defense is not only available to the Xanax prescription holder but also any individual authorized by the Xanax prescription holder to hold the medications on his or her behalf. <small><a href="#references">[9]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="temporary-possession">Temporary Possession</h3>
<p>The defense of temporary possession can be raised where a person takes momentary, temporary, or transitory possession of Xanax from the true owner. Under such circumstances, the person is not considered to be in legal possession of the Xanax because the person never exercised complete dominion and control over the Xanax. <small><a href="#references">[10]</a></small></p>
<p>Examples of temporary possession are when a person is handed Xanax by the true owner and asked to hide it during a police encounter, such as a traffic stop; when holding Xanax in the presence of a <a href="#dealing">drug dealer</a> for the sole purpose of verifying or testing the Xanax prior to purchasing it; or when passing the Xanax from the owner to a third person.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/893.13">Florida Statute 893.13(6)(a)</a>, it is a felony to possess any amount of <abbr title="Tetrahydrocannabinol">THC</abbr>, a cannabis concentrate, even if the total weight of the cannabis concentrate containing the <abbr title="Tetrahydrocannabinol">THC</abbr> is less than twenty (20) grams.</p>
<p>Cannabis concentrates are extracted from cannabis and contain a highly potent level of <abbr title="Tetrahydrocannabinol">THC</abbr> and come in many forms, such as cannabis wax, cannabis resin, cannabis oil, hashish oil, cannabis budder, and cannabis crumble. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>

<h3 id="cannabidiol">Cannabidiol (CBD)</h3>
<p>It is lawful to possess any <abbr title="Cannabidiol">CBD</abbr> product that contains no more than 0.1 percent residual <abbr title="Tetrahydrocannabinol">THC</abbr>. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h3>
<p>If the cannabis was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have to comply with the law of constructive possession, which requires the prosecutor to prove the following two elements before you can be convicted of Possession of Cannabis Concentrates: <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the cannabis concentrates' presence;</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the cannabis concentrate, which means more than the mere ability to reach out and touch the cannabis concentrate. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it can be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive Possession of Cannabis Concentrates.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found cannabis in the glove box, they would be unable to convict you of Possession of Marijuana unless they had some proof that you knew the cannabis was present.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend takes his personal stash of cannabis concentrate and places it at his feet. The police then stop you, see your friend’s stash, and arrest both of you. They should be unable to convict you of Possession of Cannabis Concentrates because even though you knew the marijuana was there, your friend is the only person who exercised dominion and control over it.</blockquote>
<h3 id="illegal-search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>More often than not, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search; or they may coerce a person into agreeing to a search. If we can prove that either instance occurred, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained.</p>
<p>Other suppression possibilities that may present themselves are: if law enforcement obtained a search warrant in bad faith or if you were arrested without probable cause.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-knowledge">Lack of Knowledge</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative defense to the crime of Possession of Cannabis Concentrates if you can prove that you did not know the substance in your possession was a cannabis concentrate. Importantly, this defense requires you to testify to your lack of knowledge of the substance’s illegal nature. <small><a href="#references">[5]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="legal-disposal">Legal Disposal Defense</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative defense to the charge of Possession of Cannabis Concentrates for a person to briefly possess cannabis concentrate without a prescription for the sole purpose of legally disposing of it. <small><a href="#references">[6]</a></small></p>
<p>In order to raise a legal disposal defense, the cannabis concentrate must have been acquired without an unlawful intent, possessed for a brief period of time, solely for the purpose of disposing of the cannabis concentrate without delay.</p>
<h3 id="medical-necessity">Medical Necessity</h3>
<p>The defense of medical necessity can be used when a person suffers from a physical illness or ailment for which there was no lawful medication available to properly treat the illness or ailment and cannabis was the only substance that could relieve the pain or suffering of the person. <small><a href="#references">[7]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="overdose-defense">Overdose Defense</h3>
<p>A person who is experiencing a drug-related overdose that needs medical assistance, or a person assisting the person that needs medical assistance, is immune from prosecution for Possession of Cannabis Concentrates if it can be shown the evidence was obtained as a result of the overdose and need for medical assistance. <small><a href="#references">[8]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="prescription-defense">Prescription Defense</h3>
<p>It is a defense to the crime of Possession of Cannabis Conentrates if the cannabis concentrate was lawfully obtained from a practitioner or pursuant to a valid prescription or order of a practitioner while acting in the course of his or her professional practice. <small><a href="#references">[9]</a></small></p>
<p>Importantly, the Prescription Defense is not only available to the cannabis concentrate prescription holder but also any individual authorized by the cannabis concentrate prescription holder to hold the medication on his or her behalf. <small><a href="#references">[10]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="temporary-possession">Temporary Possession</h3>
<p>The defense of temporary possession can be raised where a person takes momentary, temporary, or transitory possession of a cannabis concentrate from the true owner. Under such circumstances, the person is not considered to be in legal possession of the cannabis concentrate because the person never exercised complete dominion and control over the cannabis concentrate. <small><a href="#references">[11]</a></small></p>
<p>Examples of temporary possession are when a person is handed a cannabis concentrate by the true owner and asked to hide it during a police encounter, such as a traffic stop; or when holding a cannabis concentrate in the presence of a <a href="#sale_or_delivery_of_cannabis">drug dealer</a> for the sole purpose of verifying or testing the cannabis concentrate prior to purchasing it; or when passing the cannabis concentrate from the owner to a third person.</p>

<blockquote class="half">Florida law requires that your driver’s license be suspended for six months upon conviction.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">In Florida, Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid, commonly known as GHB, is a Schedule I controlled substance and it is a Third Degree Felony to possess less than 1 kilogram of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>.</p>
<p>As a Schedule I substance, <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> is considered to have a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in the United States.</p>

<p>Possession of 1 kilogram or more of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> is prosecuted as <a href="#trafficking_in_ghb">Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr></a>.

<p>As a result, a person could have a mixture that contain less than 1 kilogram of pure <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>, but because the mixture’s total weight is more than 1 kilogram, the person would be guilty of <a href="#trafficking_in_ghb">Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr></a> in Florida and subject to a minimum-mandatory prison sentence.</p>

<h3 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h3>
<p>If the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have to comply with the law of constructive possession, which requires the prosecutor to prove the following two elements before you can be convicted of Possession of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>: <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>’s presence;</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>, which means more than the mere ability to reach out and touch the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it can be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive Possession of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police find a container of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> in the glove box, they would be unable to convict you of Possession of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> unless they had some proof that you knew the container of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> was present.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend takes a container of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> and places it at his feet. The police then stop you, see your friend’s container, and arrest both of you. They should be unable to convict you of Possession of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>, because even though you knew the container of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> was present, your friend is the only person who exercised dominion and control over it.</blockquote>
<h3 id="illegal-search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>More often than not, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search; or they may coerce a person into agreeing to a search. If we can prove that either instance occurred, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained.</p>
<p>Other suppression possibilities that may present themselves are: if law enforcement obtained a search warrant in bad faith or if you were arrested without probable cause.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-knowledge">Lack of Knowledge</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative defense to the crime of Possession of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> if you can prove that you did not know the substance in your possession was <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>. Importantly, this defense requires you to testify to your lack of knowledge of the substance’s illegal nature. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="legal-disposal">Legal Disposal Defense</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative defense to the charge of Possession of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> for a person to briefly possess <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> without a prescription for the sole purpose of legally disposing of it. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<p>In order to raise a legal disposal defense, the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> must have been acquired without an unlawful intent, possessed for a brief period of time, solely for the purpose of disposing of the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> without delay.</p>
<h3 id="overdose-defense">Overdose Defense</h3>
<p>Any person who is experiencing a drug-related overdose and needs medical assistance, or a person assisting the person that needs medical assistance, is immune from prosecution for possession of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> if it can be shown the evidence was obtained as a result of the overdose and need for medical assistance. <small><a href="#references">[5]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="prescription-defense">Prescription Defense</h3>
<p>While it is rare, some people are actually prescribed <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>. So if you can produce a valid <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> prescription that pre-dated your arrest, you will have an absolute defense to the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> charge. <small><a href="#references">[6]</a></small></p>
<p>Importantly, the Prescription Defense is not only available to the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> prescription holder but also any individual authorized by the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> prescription holder to hold the medications on his or her behalf. <small><a href="#references">[7]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="temporary-possession">Temporary Possession</h3>
<p>The defense of temporary possession can be raised where a person takes momentary, temporary, or transitory possession of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> from the true owner. Under such circumstances, the person is not considered to be in legal possession of the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> because the person never exercised complete dominion and control over the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>. <small><a href="#references">[5]</a></small></p>
<p>Examples of temporary possession are when a person is quickly handed <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> by the true owner during a police encounter, such as a traffic stop, and asked to hide it; or when holding <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> in the presence of a <a href="#sale_or_delivery_of_ghb">drug dealer</a> for the sole purpose of verifying or testing the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> prior to purchasing it; or when passing the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> from the owner to a third person.</p>

<h3 id="illegal-search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>More often than not, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search; or they may coerce a person into agreeing to a search. If we can prove that either instance occurred, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained.</p>
<p>Other suppression possibilities that may present themselves are: if law enforcement obtained a search warrant in bad faith or if you were arrested without probable cause.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-knowledge">Lack of Knowledge</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative defense to the crime of Possession of Hydrocodone if you can prove that you did not know the substance in your possession was Hydrocodone. Importantly, this defense requires you to testify to your lack of knowledge of the substance’s illegal nature. <small><a href="#references">[5]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="legal-disposal">Legal Disposal Defense</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative  defense to the charge of Possession of Hydrocodone for a person to briefly possess Hydrocodone without a prescription for the sole purpose of legally disposing of it. <small><a href="#references">[6]</a></small></p>
<p>In order to raise a legal disposal defense, the Hydrocodone must have been acquired without an unlawful intent, possessed for a brief period of time, solely for the purpose of disposing of the Hydrocodone without delay.</p>
<h3 id="overdose-defense">Overdose Defense</h3>
<p>Any person who is experiencing a drug-related overdose and needs medical assistance, or a person assisting the person that needs medical assistance, is immune from prosecution for Possession of Hydrocodone if it can be shown the evidence was obtained as a result of the overdose and need for medical assistance. <small><a href="#references">[7]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="prescription-defense">Prescription Defense</h3>
<p>While it seems obvious, many people are arrested for possession of Hydrocodone when they are unable to produce a valid prescription or a recently dispensed pill bottle. These arrests usually occur when law enforcement have stopped you for suspicious behavior and discover Hydrocodone stored in an unconventional container.</p>
<p>However, if you can produce a valid Hydrocodone prescription that pre-dated your arrest or have a doctor execute a letter that they dispensed a sample amount, you will have an absolute defense to the Hydrocodone charge. <small><a href="#references">[8]</a></small></p>
<p>Importantly, the Prescription Defense is not only available to the Hydrocodone prescription holder but also any individual authorized by the Hydrocodone prescription holder to hold the medications on his or her behalf. <small><a href="#references">[9]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="temporary-possession">Temporary Possession</h3>
<p>The defense of temporary possession can be raised where a person takes momentary, temporary, or transitory possession of hydrocodone from the true owner. Under such circumstances, the person is not considered to be in legal possession of the hydrocodone because the person never exercised complete dominion and control over the hydrocodone. <small><a href="#references">[10]</a></small></p>
<p>Examples of temporary possession are when a person is handed Hydrocodone by the true owner and asked to hide it during a police encounter, such as a traffic stop; or when holding Hydrocodone in the presence of a <a href="#dealing">drug dealer</a> for the sole purpose of verifying or testing the Hydrocodone prior to purchasing it; or when passing the Hydrocodone from the owner to a third person.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Possession of MDMA in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">In Florida, MDMA (Ecstasy) is a Schedule I controlled substance.</blockquote>
<p>Known by the street name Ecstasy, MDMA stands for 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine, which is a highly addictive hallucinogenic substance.</p>
<p itemprop="description">In Florida, MDMA or Ecstacy is a Schedule I controlled substance and it is a Third Degree Felony to possess less than 10 grams of MDMA or Ecstacy.</p>
<p>As a Schedule I controlled substance, MDMA is considered to have a high potential for abuse and has no currently accepted medical use in Florida or the United States.</p>
<h2>Trafficking Threshold </h2>
<p>Possession of 10 grams or more of MDMA is prosecuted as <a href="#trafficking_in_mdma">Trafficking in MDMA</a>. Importantly, the weight is determined by how much the MDMA or Ecstacy pills weigh, not by how much pure MDMA is contained within the pills.</p>
<p>As a result, a person could have several pills that contain less than 10 grams of pure MDMA, but because the pills collectively weigh more than 10 grams, the person would be guilty of Trafficking in MDMA under Florida law and subject to a minimum-mandatory prison sentence.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for MDMA Possession</h2>
<p>The crime of Possession of MDMA is a Third Degree Felony in Florida and punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Possession of MDMA is assigned a Level 3 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a> and a judge may sentence a person convicted of Possession of MDMA to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of five years in prison.</p>
<h3 id="driver-license-suspension">Driver License Suspension</h3>
<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/322.055">Florida Statute 322.055</a>, any person convicted of Possession of MDMA will have their driver’s license or driving privilege suspended for six months by the Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr>.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to MDMA Possession</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific or common defenses to the crime of Possession of MDMA are:</p>

<h3 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h3>
<p>If the MDMA was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have to comply with the law of constructive possession, which requires the prosecutor to prove the following two elements before you can be convicted of Possession of MDMA: <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the MDMA’s presence;</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the MDMA, which means more than the mere ability to reach out and touch the MDMA. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it can be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive Possession of MDMA.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police find MDMA in the glove box, they would be unable to convict you of Possession of MDMA unless they had some proof that you knew the MDMA was present.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend takes a bag of MDMA and places it at his feet.

<h3 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h3>
<p>If the Oxycodone was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have to comply with the law of constructive possession, which requires the prosecutor to prove the following two elements before you can be convicted of Possession of Oxycodone: <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the Oxycodone’s presence;</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the Oxycodone, which means more than the mere ability to reach out and touch the Oxycodone. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it can be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive Possession of Oxycodone.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police find Oxycodone in the glove box, they would be unable to convict you of Possession of Oxycodone unless they had some proof that you knew the Oxycodone was present.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend places a container of Oxycodone at his feet. The police then stop you, see your friend’s container, and arrest both of you. They should be unable to convict you of Possession of Oxycodone, because even though you knew the Oxycodone was present, your friend is the only person who exercised dominion and control over it.</blockquote>
<h3 id="expiration-date">Expired Prescription Drugs</h3>
<p>Contrary to popular opinion, it is not illegal to possess expired Oxycodone as long as it was originally prescribed to you.</p>
<p>All the expiration date reflects is the final day that the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a medication. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>However, studies have shown that most prescription and over-the-counter drugs are perfectly good to use up to 15 years after the expiration date. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="illegal-search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>More often than not, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search; or they may coerce a person into agreeing to a search. If we can prove that either instance occurred, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained.</p>
<p>Other suppression possibilities that may present themselves are: if law enforcement obtained a search warrant in bad faith or if you were arrested without probable cause.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-knowledge">Lack of Knowledge</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative defense to the crime of Possession of Oxycodone if you can prove that you did not know the substance in your possession was Oxycodone. Importantly, this defense requires you to testify to your lack of knowledge of the substance’s illegal nature. <small><a href="#references">[5]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="legal-disposal">Legal Disposal Defense</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative  defense to the charge of Possession of Oxycodone for a person to briefly possess Oxycodone without a prescription for the sole purpose of legally disposing of it. <small><a href="#references">[6]</a></small></p>
<p>In order to raise a legal disposal defense, the Oxycodone must have been acquired without an unlawful intent, possessed for a brief period of time, solely for the purpose of disposing of the Oxycodone without delay.</p>
<h3 id="overdose-defense">Overdose Defense</h3>
<p>Any person who is experiencing a drug-related overdose and needs medical assistance, or a person assisting the person that needs medical assistance, is immune from prosecution for Possession of Oxycodone if it can be shown the evidence was obtained as a result of the overdose and need for medical assistance. <small><a href="#references">[7]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="prescription-defense">Prescription Defense</h3>
<p>While it seems obvious, many people are arrested for possession of Oxycodone when they are unable to produce a valid prescription or a recently dispensed pill bottle. These arrests usually occur when law enforcement have stopped you for suspicious behavior and discover the Oxycodone in an unconventional container.</p>
<p>However, if you can produce a valid Oxycodone prescription that pre-dated your arrest or have a doctor execute a letter that they dispensed a sample amount, you will have an absolute defense to the Oxycodone charge. <small><a href="#references">[8]</a></small></p>
<p>Importantly, the Prescription Defense is not only available to the Oxycodone prescription holder but also any individual authorized by the Oxycodone prescription holder to hold the medications on his or her behalf. <small><a href="#references">[9]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="temporary-possession">Temporary Possession</h3>
<p>The defense of temporary possession can be raised where a person takes momentary, temporary, or transitory possession of oxycodone from the true owner. Under such circumstances, the person is not considered to be in legal possession of the oxycodone because the person never exercised complete dominion and control over the oxycodone. <small><a href="#references">[10]</a></small></p>
<p>Examples of temporary possession are when a person is handed oxycodone by the true owner and asked to hide it during a police encounter, such as a traffic stop; when holding oxycodone in the presence of a <a href="#dealing">drug dealer</a> for the sole purpose of verifying or testing the oxycodone prior to purchasing it; or when passing the oxycodone from the owner to a third person.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/893.147">Florida Statute 893.147(1)</a>, the crime of Possession of Drug Paraphernalia is committed when a person possesses any item that is used, intended to be used, or designed to be used as “Drug Paraphernalia.”</p>
<h3>Drug Paraphernalia</h3>
<p>Drug Paraphernalia is defined as any item used to plant, propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, package, repackage, store, contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce an illegal or controlled substance. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h4>What Qualifies as Drug Paraphernalia</h4>
<p>In determining whether an item qualifies as drug paraphernalia, courts consider the proximity of the item to any controlled substances, the existence of residue on the item, whether the item can be used for legitimate purposes, and expert testimony concerning the item’s use. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>For example, the presence of even a minuscule quantity of drug residue on an item is sufficient evidence to prove the item is Drug Paraphernalia. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small> But if the alleged paraphernalia tests negative for drug residue, the prosecutor must introduce other evidence to demonstrate the item was intended to be used for an illicit purpose. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>

<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Sale or Delivery of Cocaine</h2>
<p>The crime of Sale or Delivery of Cocaine is a Second Degree Felony in Florida and punishable by up to 15 years in prison, 15 years of probation, and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Sale or Delivery of Cocaine is assigned a Level 5 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a> and a judge may sentence a person convicted of Sale or Delivery of Cocaine to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of 15 years in prison.</p>

<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Sale or Delivery of Cocaine</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Sale or Delivery of Cocaine are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</a></li>
<li><a href="#illegal-search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</a></li>
<li><a href="#lack-of-knowledge">Lack of Knowledge</a></li>
<li><a href="#personal-use">Personal Use</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h3>
<p>If the cocaine was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have to comply with the law of constructive possession, which requires the prosecutor to prove the following two elements before you can be convicted of Sale or Delivery of Cocaine: <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the Cocaine’s presence; and</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the cocaine, which means more than the mere ability to reach out and touch the cocaine. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it can be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive Sale or Delivery of Cocaine.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found cocaine in the glove box, they would be unable to convict you of Sale or Delivery of Cocaine unless they had some proof that you knew the cocaine was present.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend takes a large bag of cocaine and places it at his feet. The police then stop you, see your friend’s bag, and arrest both of you. They should be unable to convict you of Sale or Delivery of Cocaine because even though you knew the cocaine was present, your friend is the only person who exercised dominion and control over it.</blockquote>
<h3 id="illegal-search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>More often than not, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search; or they may coerce a person into agreeing to a search. If we can prove that either instance occurred, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained.</p>
<p>Other suppression possibilities that may present themselves are: if law enforcement obtained a search warrant in bad faith or if you were arrested without probable cause.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-knowledge">Lack of Knowledge</h3>
<p>It is an affirmative defense to the crime of Sale or Delivery of Cocaine if you can prove that you did not know the substance in your possession was cocaine. Because knowledge is an affirmative defense, you would be required to testify to a lack of knowledge of the substance’s illegal nature. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="personal-use">Personal Use</h3>
<p>It is a defense to the crime of Sale or Delivery of Cocaine that the cocaine was possessed for personal use. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<p>In such cases, the State would have to present evidence that is inconsistent with personal possession; such as an abnormal quantity of drugs, scales, bundled money, ledgers, or distribution paraphernalia.</p>

<h3 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h3>
<p>If the MDMA was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have to comply with the law of constructive possession, which requires the prosecutor to prove the following two elements before you can be convicted of Sale or Delivery of MDMA: <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Trafficking in Illegal Drugs in Florida</h1>
<p itemprop="description">Florida vigorously prosecutes individuals caught with trafficking amounts of drugs. And even though a person may not be a true “drug dealer” or is not a leader in a drug trafficking organization, the law requires the imposition of mandatory-minimum prison sentences.</p>
<p>Some of the most commonly charged crimes involving the illegal trafficking in drugs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#trafficking_in_cannabis">Trafficking in Cannabis</a></li>
<li><a href="#trafficking_in_cocaine">Trafficking in Cocaine</a></li>
<li><a href="#trafficking_in_fentanyl">Trafficking in Fentanyl</a></li>
<li><a href="#trafficking_in_ghb">Trafficking in GHB</a></li>
<li><a href="#trafficking_in_heroin">Trafficking in Heroin</a></li>
<li><a href="#trafficking_in_hydrocodone">Trafficking in Hydrocodone</a></li>
<li><a href="#trafficking_in_mdma">Trafficking in MDMA (Ecstasy)</a></li>
<li><a href="#trafficking_in_methamphetamine">Trafficking in Methamphetamine (Crystal Meth or Meth)</a></li>
<li><a href="#trafficking_in_oxycodone">Trafficking in Oxycodone</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to harsh criminal penalties of fines, prison sentences, and lengthy probation, individuals involved in the drug trade may also be subject to civil penalties such as forfeiture of their home, vehicles, or money, that the government believes is linked to the drug trade.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition of Drug Trafficking</h2>
<p>Drug Trafficking is defined as the intentional sale, purchase, manufacture, delivery, possession, or transportation into Florida of a “trafficking amount” of drugs.</p>
<h3>Florida Drug Trafficking Thresholds</h3>
<p>Below is the minimum threshold quantity needed to support a trafficking charge for Florida’s most commonly encountered illegal drugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cannabis: 25 pounds or 300 plants</li>
<li>Cocaine: 28 grams</li>
<li>Fentanyl: 4 grams</li>
<li><abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>: 1 kilogram</li>
<li>Hydrocodone: 14 grams</li>
<li>Heroin: 4 grams</li>
<li><abbr title="Lysergic Acid Diethylamide">LSD</abbr>: 1 gram</li>
<li><abbr title="3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine">MDMA</abbr> (Ecstasy): 10 grams</li>
<li>Oxycodone: 7 grams</li>
</ul>
<p>These amounts are just the minimum amount needed to support a drug trafficking charge; as the amount increases, so does the potentially applicable minimum-mandatory sentence increase.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Drug Trafficking</h2>
<p>Florida Statute 893.135 provides for the following mandatory minimum prison sentences and fines for trafficking in certain quantities of illegal drugs:</p>

<h3 id="mandatory-minimum">Mandatory Minimum Sentences</h3>
<p>In drug trafficking cases, the statutorily required mandatory minimum sentence acts as the sentencing floor and a judge cannot sentence a person convicted of drug trafficking below the statutorily required mandatory minimum sentence.</p>
<p>However, mandatory minimum drug trafficking sentences are eligible for incentive gain time and a person will only have to serve 85% of the mandatory minimum sentence provided they don't forfeit any of the gain time due to bad behavior while in prison. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Drug Trafficking</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, commonly raised drug trafficking defenses include:</p>
<h3>Entrapment</h3>
<p>Entrapment is occurs when an undercover law enforcement officer or confidential informant induces a person to commit a criminal offense that the person would otherwise have been unlikely to commit. If it is determined that you were entrapped, the court can dismiss the charges against you.</p>
<h3>Illegal Search or Seizure</h3>
<p>Often, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search when they otherwise would not be required to; coerce people into agreeing to a search; arrest people without probable cause; or obtain search warrants in bad faith.</p>
<p>If any of these can be proven through the filing of a <a href="#criminal_defenses_motion_to_suppress">Motion to Suppress</a>, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States; which can lead to an outright dismissal of the case.</p>
<h3>Substantial Assistance</h3>
<p>While not technically a defense, Substantial Assistance is the most commonly utilized method to avoid the minimum-mandatory sentencing required for the crime of Trafficking in Cocaine.</p>
<p>The state attorney is authorized by statute to ask the court to reduce or suspend a sentence of any person who is convicted of drug trafficking when the person provides substantial assistance in the identification, arrest, or conviction of any other person engaged in trafficking in controlled substances.</p>
<p>This remedy is routinely offered pursuant to a “Substantial Assistance Contract” that requires you to “assist” law enforcement in arresting a specific amount of individuals involved in trafficking drugs within a limited period of time.</p>
<p>However, if you are unable to deliver the specified amount of people, you will be required to serve the applicable minimum-mandatory prison sentence; regardless of how hard you tried to “assist” law enforcement.</p>

<p>If a person is caught trafficking in cannabis, the minimum penalties they face are determined by the following cannabis trafficking thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 years prison / $25,000 fine
									<ul>
<li>25 to 1,999 pounds of cannabis; or</li>
<li>300 to 1,999 cannabis plants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>7 years prison / $50,000 fine
									<ul>
<li>2,000 to 9,999 pounds of cannabis; or</li>
<li>2,000 to 9,999 cannabis plants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>15 years prison / $200,000 fine
									<ul>
<li>10,000 pounds or more of cannabis; or</li>
<li>10,000 or more cannabis plants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Trafficking in Cannabis</h2>
<p>The crime of Trafficking in Cannabis is a First Degree Felony in Florida and, depending on the amount of cannabis, is assigned either a Level 8 or a Level 9 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.</p>
<p>Under Florida law, unless the State Attorney agrees to waive the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements, the penalties are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#25-pounds">Trafficking in 25 to 1,999 pounds of cannabis or 300 to 1,999 cannabis plants</a></li>
<li><a href="#300-pounds">Trafficking in 2,000 to 9,999 pounds of Cannabis or 2,000 to 9,999 cannabis plants</a></li>
<li><a href="#10000-pounds">Trafficking in 10,000 pounds or more of Cannabis, or 10,000 or more Cannabis plants</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="25-pounds">Trafficking in 25 to 1,999 pounds of cannabis, or 300 to 1,999 cannabis plants</h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 25 to 1,999 pounds of cannabis, or 300 to 1,999 cannabis plants, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years in prison and a $25,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="300-pounds">Trafficking in 2,000 to 9,999 pounds of cannabis, or 2,000 to 9,999 cannabis plants</h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 2,000 to 9,999 pounds of cannabis, or 2,000 to 9,999 cannabis plants, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years in prison and a $50,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="10000-pounds">Trafficking in 10,000 pounds or more of cannabis, or 10,000 or more cannabis plants</h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 10,000 pounds or more of cannabis, or 10,000 or more cannabis plants, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $200,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="mandatory-minimum">Mandatory Minimum Sentences</h3>
<p>In drug trafficking cases, the statutorily required mandatory minimum sentence acts as the sentencing floor and a judge cannot sentence a person convicted of drug trafficking below the statutorily required mandatory minimum sentence.</p>
<p>However, mandatory minimum drug trafficking sentences are eligible for incentive gain time and a person will only have to serve 85% of the mandatory minimum sentence provided they don't forfeit any of the gain time due to bad behavior while in prison. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Trafficking in Cannabis</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Trafficking in Cannabis include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#entrapment">Entrapment</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="#substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="entrapment">Entrapment</h3>
<p>Entrapment occurs when an undercover law enforcement officer or confidential informant induces a person to commit a criminal offense that the person would otherwise have been unlikely to commit. If it can be shown you were entrapped, the court can dismiss the charges against you.</p>
<h3 id="search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>Often, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search when they otherwise would not be required to; coerce people into agreeing to a search; arrest people without probable cause; or obtain search warrants in bad faith.</p>
<p>If any of these can be proven through the filing of a <a href="#criminal_defenses_motion_to_suppress">Motion to Suppress</a>, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States; which can lead to an outright dismissal of the case.</p>
<h3 id="insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>The prosecutor can only prove you possessed cannabis for the purposes of trafficking in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#actual-possession">Actual Possession</a></li>
<li><a href="#constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</a></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="actual-possession">Actual Possession</h4>
<p>To prove that you actually possessed cannabis, the prosecutor has to show the cannabis was found on your person. So if the cannabis was found in your personally owned car while you were driving, the prosecutor would have a case involving actual possession of cannabis.</p>
<h4 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h4>
<p>On the other hand, if the cannabis was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have a much more difficult time proving you possessed the cannabis because they would have to comply with the law of constructive possession.</p>
<p>The law of constructive possession requires the prosecutor to prove each of three distinct elements before you can be convicted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the cannabis’s presence;</li>
<li>Knowledge the substance was cannabis; and</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the cannabis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it could be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive possession.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found cannabis in the trunk, they would be unable to convict you of Trafficking in Cannabis unless they had some proof that you knew the cannabis was there.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found a cannabis package in the back seat, but in plain view. They would be unable to convict you of Trafficking in Cannabis unless they had some proof that you knew the package contained cannabis.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend takes a package with cannabis in it and places it in the passenger side door pocket. The police then stop you, see your friend’s package, and arrest both of you. As long as there is not evidence you were working in conjunction with your friend, they would be unable to convict you of Trafficking in Cannabis because, even though you knew the cannabis was there, your friend is the only person who had dominion and control over it.</blockquote>
<h3 id="substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</h3>
<p>While not technically a defense, Substantial Assistance is the most commonly utilized method to avoid the minimum-mandatory sentencing required for the crime of Trafficking in Cannabis.</p>
<p>The state attorney is authorized by statute to ask the court to reduce or suspend a sentence of any person who is convicted of drug trafficking when the person provides substantial assistance in the identification, arrest, or conviction of any other person engaged in trafficking in controlled substances.</p>
<p>This remedy is routinely offered pursuant to a “Substantial Assistance Contract” that requires you to “assist” law enforcement in arresting a specific amount of individuals involved in trafficking drugs within a limited period of time.</p>
<p>However, if you are unable to deliver the specified amount of people, you will be required to serve the applicable mandatory minimum prison sentence; regardless of how hard you tried to “assist” law enforcement.</p>
<h3 id="valid-prescription">Valid Prescription</h3>
<p>While it seems obvious, many people are arrested for Trafficking in Cannabis when they are unable to immediately produce a valid prescription or a recently dispensed pill bottle. These arrests usually occur when law enforcement have stopped your for suspicious behavior and discover the Cannabis in an unconventional area.</p>
<p>However, a valid prescription is a complete defense to Trafficking in Cannabis if the trafficking charge is based solely on the amount of Cannabis you had in your possession. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Trafficking in GHB in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Florida imposes mandatory minimum prison sentences on people convicted of Trafficking in GHB.</blockquote>
<p>Florida imposes mandatory minimum prison sentences and stiff fines for people convicted of Trafficking in GHB.</p>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/893.135">Florida Statute 893.135(1)(h)(1)</a>, the crime of Trafficking in GHB is committed when a person knowingly possesses, sells, purchases, manufactures, delivers, or transports 1 kilogram or more of GHB.</p>
<h3><abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> Trafficking Thresholds</h3>
<p>If a person is caught trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>, the minimum penalties they will face are determined by the following <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> trafficking thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 to 4 kilograms of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>;
									<ul>
<li>3 years prison / $50,000 fine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5 to 9 kilograms of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>;
									<ul>
<li>7 years prison / $100,000 fine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10 kilograms or more of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>;
									<ul>
<li>15 years prison / $250,000 fine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Weight Determination</h4>
<p>The trafficking weight is determined by the aggregate weight of the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> mixture, not by the amount of pure <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> in the mixture.</p>
<p>As a result, a person could have a mixture that contain less than 1 kilogram of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>, but because the mixture weighs more than 1 kilogram, the person would be guilty of Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> instead of simple <a href="#possession_of_ghb">Possession of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr></a>.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr></h2>
<p>The crime of Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> is a First Degree Felony and, depending on the amount of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>, is assigned either a Level 8 or a Level 9 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.</p>
<p>Under Florida law, unless the State Attorney agrees to waive the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements, the minimum sentences depends on whether you are convicted of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#1-kilogram">Trafficking in 1 to 4 kilograms of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr></a></li>
<li><a href="#5-kilograms">Trafficking in 5 to 9 kilograms of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr></a></li>
<li><a href="#10-kilograms">Trafficking in 10 kilograms or more of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr></a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-kilogram">Trafficking in 1 to 4 kilograms of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr></h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 1 kilogram or more, but less than 5 kilograms, of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years in prison and a $50,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="5-kilograms">Trafficking in 5 to 9 kilograms of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr></h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 5 kilograms or more, but less than 10 kilograms, of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years in prison and a $100,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="10-kilograms">Trafficking in 10 kilograms or more of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr></h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 10 kilograms or more of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="driver-license-suspension">Driver License Suspension</h3>
<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/322.055">Florida Statute 322.055</a>, a person convicted of Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> will have their driver’s license or driving privilege suspended for six months by the Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr>.</p>
<h3 id="mandatory-minimum">Mandatory Minimum Sentences</h3>
<p>In drug trafficking cases, the statutorily required mandatory minimum sentence acts as the sentencing floor and a judge cannot sentence a person convicted of drug trafficking below the statutorily required mandatory minimum sentence.</p>
<p>However, mandatory minimum drug trafficking sentences are eligible for incentive gain time and a person will only have to serve 85% of the mandatory minimum sentence provided they don't forfeit any of the gain time due to bad behavior while in prison. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="professional-license-suspension">Professional License Suspension</h3>
<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/893.11">Florida Statute 893.11</a>, a person convicted of Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> will be subject to the emergency suspension of any Professional License issued by the State of Florida that authorizes the practicing of a profession or trade.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr></h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#entrapment">Entrapment</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="#substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="entrapment">Entrapment</h3>
<p>Entrapment occurs when an undercover law enforcement officer or confidential informant induces a person to commit a criminal offense that the person would otherwise have been unlikely to commit. If it can be shown you were entrapped, the court can dismiss the charges against you.</p>
<h3 id="search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>Often, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search when they otherwise would not be required to; coerce people into agreeing to a search; arrest people without probable cause; or obtain search warrants in bad faith.</p>
<p>If any of these can be proven through the filing of a <a href="#criminal_defenses_motion_to_suppress">Motion to Suppress</a>, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States; which can lead to an outright dismissal of the case.</p>
<h3 id="insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>The prosecutor can only prove you possessed <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> for the purposes of trafficking in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#actual-possession">Actual Possession</a></li>
<li><a href="#constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</a></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="actual-possession">Actual Possession</h4>
<p>To prove that you actually possessed <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>, the prosecutor has to show the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> was found on your person. So if a container with <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> was found in your pocket, the prosecutor would have a case involving actual possession of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>.</p>
<h4 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h4>
<p>On the other hand, if the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have a much more difficult time proving you possessed the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> because they would have to comply with the law of constructive possession.</p>
<p>The law of constructive possession requires the prosecutor to prove each of three distinct elements before you can be convicted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>’s presence;</li>
<li>Knowledge the substance was <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>; and</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it could be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive possession.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found a bottle of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> in the glove box, they would be unable to convict you of Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> unless they had some proof that you knew the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> was there.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found a bottle of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> on the floor-board, but in plain view. They would be unable to convict you of Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> unless they had some proof that you knew the bottle contained <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend places a bottle of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> in the passenger side storage pocket. The police then stop you, see your friend’s bottle, and arrest both of you. They should be unable to convict you of Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> because even though you knew the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> was there, your friend is the only person who exercised dominion and control over the container.</blockquote>
<h3 id="substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</h3>
<p>While not technically a defense, Substantial Assistance is the most commonly utilized method to avoid the mandatory minimum sentencing required for the crime of Trafficking in <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>.</p>
<p>The state attorney is authorized by statute to ask the court to reduce or suspend a sentence of any person who is convicted of drug trafficking when the person provides substantial assistance in the identification, arrest, or conviction of any other person engaged in trafficking in controlled substances.</p>
<p>This remedy is routinely offered pursuant to a “Substantial Assistance Contract” that requires you to “assist” law enforcement in arresting a specific amount of individuals involved in trafficking drugs within a limited period of time.</p>
<p>However, if you are unable to deliver the specified amount of people, you will be required to serve the applicable mandatory minimum prison sentence; regardless of how hard you tried to “assist” law enforcement.</p>
<h3 id="Valid-Prescription">Valid Prescription</h3>
<p>If you can show you were validly prescribed the <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr>, you may be able to have the charges dismissed if your charge is based solely on the amount of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> in your possession. The valid prescription defense does not apply if you were selling or dealing in your personal supply of <abbr title="Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid">GHB</abbr> though.</p>

<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/893.11">Florida Statute 893.11</a>, a person convicted of Trafficking in Hydrocodone will be subject to the emergency suspension of any Professional License issued by the State of Florida that authorizes the practicing of a profession or trade.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Trafficking in Hydrocodone</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Trafficking in Hydrocodone include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#entrapment">Entrapment</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="#valid-prescription">Valid Prescription</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="entrapment">Entrapment</h3>
<p>Entrapment occurs when an undercover law enforcement officer or confidential informant induces a person to commit a criminal offense that the person would otherwise have been unlikely to commit. If it can be shown you were entrapped, the court can dismiss the charges against you.</p>
<h3 id="search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>Often, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search when they otherwise would not be required to; coerce people into agreeing to a search; arrest people without probable cause; or obtain search warrants in bad faith.</p>
<p>If any of these can be proven through the filing of a <a href="#criminal_defenses_motion_to_suppress">Motion to Suppress</a>, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States; which can lead to an outright dismissal of the case.</p>
<h3 id="insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>The prosecutor can only prove you possessed hydrocodone for the purposes of trafficking in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#actual-possession">Actual Possession</a></li>
<li><a href="#constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</a></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="actual-possession">Actual Possession</h4>
<p>To prove that you actually possessed hydrocodone, the prosecutor has to show the hydrocodone was found on your person. So if the hydrocodone was found in your pocket, the prosecutor would have a case involving actual possession of hydrocodone.</p>
<h4 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h4>
<p>On the other hand, if the hydrocodone was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have a much more difficult time proving you possessed the hydrocodone because they would have to comply with the law of constructive possession.</p>
<p>The law of constructive possession requires the prosecutor to prove each of three distinct elements before you can be convicted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge the hydrocodone is present;</li>
<li>Knowledge the substance was hydrocodone; and</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the hydrocodone.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it could be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive possession.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found hydrocodone in the trunk, they would be unable to convict you of Trafficking in Hydrocodone unless they had some proof that you knew the hydrocodone was there.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found a pill bottle containing hydrocodone in the back seat, but in plain view. Unless they had some proof that you knew the bottle contained hydrocodone, they would be unable to convict you of Trafficking in Hydrocodone.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend takes a pill bottle containing hydrocodone and places it in the passenger side door pocket. The police then stop you, see your friend’s pill bottle, and arrest both of you. They should be unable to convict you of Trafficking in Hydrocodone because even though you knew the pill bottle was there, your friend is the only person who had dominion and control over it.</blockquote>
<h3 id="substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</h3>
<p>While not technically a defense, Substantial Assistance is the most commonly utilized method to avoid the mandatory minimum sentencing required for the crime of Trafficking in Hydrocodone.</p>
<p>The state attorney is authorized by statute to ask the court to reduce or suspend a sentence of any person who is convicted of drug trafficking when the person provides substantial assistance in the identification, arrest, or conviction of any other person engaged in trafficking in controlled substances.</p>
<p>This remedy is routinely offered pursuant to a “Substantial Assistance Contract” that requires you to “assist” law enforcement in arresting a specific amount of individuals involved in trafficking drugs within a limited period of time.</p>
<p>However, if you are unable to deliver the specified amount of people, you will be required to serve the applicable mandatory minimum prison sentence; regardless of how hard you tried to “assist” law enforcement.</p>
<h3 id="valid-prescription">Valid Prescription</h3>
<p>While it seems obvious, many people are arrested for Trafficking in Hydrocodone when they are unable to immediately produce a valid prescription or a recently dispensed pill bottle. These arrests usually occur when law enforcement have stopped your for suspicious behavior and discover the Hydrocodone in an unconventional area.</p>
<p>However, a valid prescription is a complete defense to Trafficking in Hydrocodone if the trafficking charge is based solely on the amount of Hydrocodone you had in your possession. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Trafficking in MDMA in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Florida imposes mandatory minimum prison sentences on people convicted of Trafficking in MDMA.</blockquote>
<p>Florida imposes mandatory minimum prison sentences and fines on people convicted of Trafficking in MDMA.</p>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/893.135">Florida Statute 893.135(1)(k)(1)</a>, the crime of Trafficking in MDMA is committed when a person knowingly possesses, sells, purchases, manufactures, delivers, or transports 10 grams or more of MDMA.</p>
<h3>MDMA Trafficking Thresholds</h3>
<p>If a person is caught trafficking in MDMA, the minimum penalties they face are determined by the following MDMA trafficking thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 to 200 grams of MDMA;
									<ul>
<li>3 years prison / $50,000 fine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>200 to 400 grams of MDMA;
									<ul>
<li>7 years prison / $100,000 fine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>400 grams to 30 kilograms of MDMA;
									<ul>
<li>15 years prison / $500,000 fine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Weight Determination</h4>
<p>The trafficking weight is determined by the aggregate weight of the MDMA pills, not by the amount of pure MDMA in the pills.</p>
<p>As a result, a person could have ten MDMA pills that contain less than 10 grams of MDMA, but because the pills weigh more than 10 grams, the person would be guilty of Trafficking in MDMA instead of simple <a href="#possession_of_mdma">Possession of MDMA</a>.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Trafficking in MDMA</h2>
<p>The crime of Trafficking in MDMA is a First Degree Felony and, depending on the amount of MDMA, is assigned either a Level 8 or a Level 9 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.</p>
<p>Under Florida law, unless the State Attorney agrees to waive the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements, the minimum sentences depends on whether you are convicted of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#10-grams">Trafficking in 10 to 200 grams of MDMA</a></li>
<li><a href="#200-grams">Trafficking in 200 to 400 grams of MDMA</a></li>
<li><a href="#400-grams">Trafficking in 400 grams to 30 kilograms of MDMA</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-grams">Trafficking in 10 grams or more, but less than 200 grams, of MDMA</h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 10 grams or more, but less than 200 grams, of MDMA, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years in prison and a $50,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="200-grams">Trafficking in 200 grams or more, but less than 400 grams, of MDMA</h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 200 grams or more, but less than 400 grams, of MDMA, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years in prison and a $100,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="400-grams">Trafficking in 400 grams or more, but less than 30 kilograms, of MDMA</h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 400 grams or more, but less than 30 kilograms, of MDMA, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="mandatory-minimum">Mandatory Minimum Sentences</h3>
<p>In drug trafficking cases, the statutorily required mandatory minimum sentence acts as the sentencing floor and a judge cannot sentence a person convicted of drug trafficking below the statutorily required mandatory minimum sentence.</p>
<p>However, mandatory minimum drug trafficking sentences are eligible for incentive gain time and a person will only have to serve 85% of the mandatory minimum sentence provided they don't forfeit any of the gain time due to bad behavior while in prison. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>

<p>As a result, a person could have ten oxycodone pills whose combined dosage is less than 4 grams of Oxycodone, but because the pills weigh more than 4 grams, the person would be guilty of Trafficking in Oxycodone instead of simple <a href="#possession_of_oxycodone">Possession of Oxycodone</a>.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Trafficking in Oxycodone</h2>
<p>The crime of Trafficking in Oxycodone is a First Degree Felony and, depending on the amount of oxycodone, is assigned either a Level 8 or a Level 9 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.</p>
<p>Under Florida law, unless the State Attorney agrees to waive the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements, the minimum sentences depends on whether you are convicted of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#7-grams">Trafficking in 7 to 14 grams of Oxycodone</a></li>
<li><a href="#14-grams">Trafficking in 14 to 25 grams of Oxycodone</a></li>
<li><a href="#25-grams">Trafficking in 25 grams to 100 grams of Oxycodone</a></li>
<li><a href="#100-grams">Trafficking in 28 grams to 30 kilograms of Oxycodone</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-grams">Trafficking in 7 to 14 grams of Oxycodone</h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 7 grams or more, but less than 14 grams, of Oxycodone, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years in prison and a $50,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="14-grams">Trafficking in 14 to 25 grams, of Oxycodone</h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 14 grams or more, but less than 25 grams, of Oxycodone, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years in prison and a $100,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="25-grams">Trafficking in 25 grams to 100 grams of Oxycodone</h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 25 grams or more, but less than 100 grams, of Oxycodone, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="100-grams">Trafficking in 100 grams to 30 kilograms of Oxycodone</h3>
<p>If convicted of Trafficking in 100 grams or more, but less than 30 kilograms, of Oxycodone, a judge can impose a maximum sentence of thirty (30) years in prison, but is required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years in prison and a $750,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="mandatory-minimum">Mandatory Minimum Sentences</h3>
<p>In drug trafficking cases, the statutorily required mandatory minimum sentence acts as the sentencing floor and a judge cannot sentence a person convicted of drug trafficking below the statutorily required mandatory minimum sentence.</p>
<p>However, mandatory minimum drug trafficking sentences are eligible for incentive gain time and a person will only have to serve 85% of the mandatory minimum sentence provided they don't forfeit any of the gain time due to bad behavior while in prison. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="driver-license-suspension">Driver License Suspension</h3>
<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/322.055">Florida Statute 322.055</a>, a person convicted of Trafficking in Oxycodone will have their driver’s license or driving privilege suspended for six months by the Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr>.</p>
<h3 id="professional-license-suspension">Professional License Suspension</h3>
<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/893.11">Florida Statute 893.11</a>, a person convicted of Trafficking in Oxycodone will be subject to the emergency suspension of any Professional License issued by the State of Florida that authorizes the practicing of a profession or trade.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Trafficking in Oxycodone</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Trafficking in Oxycodone include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#entrapment">Entrapment</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="#valid-prescription">Valid Prescription</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="entrapment">Entrapment</h3>
<p>Entrapment occurs when an undercover law enforcement officer or confidential informant induces a person to commit a criminal offense that the person would otherwise have been unlikely to commit. If it can be shown you were entrapped, the court can dismiss the charges against you.</p>
<h3 id="search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>Often, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search when they otherwise would not be required to; coerce people into agreeing to a search; arrest people without probable cause; or obtain search warrants in bad faith.</p>
<p>If any of these can be proven through the filing of a <a href="#criminal_defenses_motion_to_suppress">Motion to Suppress</a>, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States; which can lead to an outright dismissal of the case.</p>
<h3 id="insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>The prosecutor can only prove you possessed oxycodone for the purposes of trafficking in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#actual-possession">Actual Possession</a></li>
<li><a href="#constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</a></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="actual-possession">Actual Possession</h4>
<p>To prove that you actually possessed oxycodone, the prosecutor has to show the oxycodone was found on your person. So if the oxycodone was found in your pocket, the prosecutor would have a case involving actual possession of oxycodone.</p>
<h4 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h4>
<p>On the other hand, if the oxycodone was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have a much more difficult time proving you possessed the oxycodone because they would have to comply with the law of constructive possession.</p>
<p>The law of constructive possession requires the prosecutor to prove each of three distinct elements before you can be convicted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge the oxycodone is present;</li>
<li>Knowledge the substance was oxycodone; and</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the oxycodone.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it could be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive possession.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found oxycodone in the trunk, they would be unable to convict you of Trafficking in Oxycodone unless they had some proof that you knew the oxycodone was there.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found a pill bottle containing oxycodone in the back seat, but in plain view. Unless they had some proof that you knew the bottle contained oxycodone, they would be unable to convict you of Trafficking in Oxycodone.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend takes a pill bottle containing oxycodone and places it in the passenger side door pocket. The police then stop you, see your friend’s pill bottle, and arrest both of you. They should be unable to convict you of Trafficking in Oxycodone because even though you knew the pill bottle was present, your friend is the only person who had dominion and control over it.</blockquote>
<h3 id="substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</h3>
<p>While not technically a defense, Substantial Assistance is the most commonly utilized method to avoid the mandatory minimum sentencing required for the crime of Trafficking in Oxycodone.</p>
<p>The state attorney is authorized by statute to ask the court to reduce or suspend a sentence of any person who is convicted of drug trafficking when the person provides substantial assistance in the identification, arrest, or conviction of any other person engaged in trafficking in controlled substances.</p>
<p>This remedy is routinely offered pursuant to a “Substantial Assistance Contract” that requires you to “assist” law enforcement in arresting a specific amount of individuals involved in trafficking drugs within a limited period of time.</p>
<p>However, if you are unable to deliver the specified amount of people, you will be required to serve the applicable mandatory minimum prison sentence; regardless of how hard you tried to “assist” law enforcement.</p>
<h3 id="valid-prescription">Valid Prescription</h3>
<p>While it seems obvious, many people are arrested for Trafficking in Oxycodone when they are unable to immediately produce a valid prescription or a recently dispensed pill bottle. These arrests usually occur when law enforcement have stopped your for suspicious behavior and discover the Oxycodone in an unconventional area.</p>
<p>However, a valid prescription is a complete defense to Trafficking in Oxycodone if the trafficking charge is based solely on the amount of Oxycodone you had in your possession. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Felony Crimes in Florida</h1>
<p>If you have been charged with a felony offense, you are probably wondering:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#definition">What is a Felony?</a></li>
<li><a href="#penalties">What are the Penalties?</a></li>
<li><a href="#record">Will I have a Criminal Record?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Felony cases are the most complicated and serious crimes in Florida. The government saves its most experienced and decorated prosecutors to handle felony cases.</p>
<p>It is important that you retain an attorney who has the experience and knowledge to challenge these prosecutors.</p>
<h2 id="definition">What is a Felony</h2>
<p itemprop="description">Felony offenses can only be handled by circuit court judges and are punishable by the possibility of more than one-year in prison. </p>
<p>Examples of felonies are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#assault_aggravated_assault">Aggravated Assault</a>,</li>
<li><a href="#battery_aggravated_battery">Aggravated Battery</a>,</li>
<li><a href="#battery_battery_on_law_enforcement_officer">Battery on Law Enforcement Officer</a>,</li>

<li><a href="#sex_lewd_or_lascivious_molestation">Lewd and Lascivious Molestation</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The list goes on...</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="penalties">Felony Penalties?</h2>
<p>Depending on the degree of the felony you are charged with, the possible penalties are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Third Degree Felony</dt>
<dd>A third degree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison, five years probation, and a $5,000 fine.</dd>
<dt>Second Degree Felony</dt>
<dd>A second-degree felony is punishable by up to fifteen years in prison, fifteen years probation, and a $10,000 fine.</dd>
<dt>First Degree Felony</dt>
<dd>A first-degree felony is punishable by up to thirty years in prison, thirty years probation, and a $10,000 fine.</dd>
<dt>Life Felony</dt>
<dd>A life felony is punishable by life in prison without the possibility of parole, or probation for the remainder of your life, and a $15,000 fine.</dd>
<dt>Capital Felony</dt>
<dd>A capital felony is punishable by death or life in prison without the possibility of parole.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Florida’s Criminal Punishment Code</h3>
<p>Felony offenses are sentenced pursuant to <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Florida’s criminal punishment code</a> (“<abbr title="Criminal Punishment Code">CPC</abbr>”), commonly referred to as a score sheet</p>
<p>A felony is assigned a numerical value based on a ranking system set by the Florida legislature. The higher the ranking, the more points your <abbr title="Criminal Punishment Code">CPC</abbr> score sheet scores.</p>
<p>If you score more than 44 points, you are subject to a minimum term of imprisonment. If you score less than 44 points, a judge is not required to sentence you to prison, but may still do so.</p>
<h3>Collateral Consequences</h3>
<p>In addition to the possibility of imprisonment, a felony conviction carries a number of collateral consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loss of your Civil Rights,</li>
<li>Ineligible to obtain State Licenses,</li>
<li>Ineligible to hold public office,</li>
<li>Ineligible for federal or state aid,</li>
<li>Inability to get hired, </li>
<li>Unable to rent an apartment, etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>Even more frustrating, if you do find a job that you are not barred by law from taking, you may still not get hired because most insurance companies will not insure a felon.</p>
<h2 id="record">Will I have a Criminal Record?</h2>
<p>Having a felony criminal records is both embarrassing and disturbing and it may be possible to have your arrest record cleared at a later date by either:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#criminal_post_conviction_sealing">Sealing Your Record</a> or</li>
<li><a href="#criminal_post_conviction_expungement">Expunging Your Record</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the manner in which your felony is ultimately resolved may affect your eligibility to clear your record at a later date. For instance, even if Adjudication is Withheld; certain felonies are ineligible to ever be sealed or expunged after a plea.</p>
<p>Please review the <a href="#criminal_post_conviction_index">sealing or expunging</a> section for more information on the criteria for this process.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Bribery in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Bribery is a Second Degree Felony in Florida.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/838.015">Florida Statute 838.015</a>, the crime of Bribery occurs when a person or a public official corruptly offers or agrees to accept a thing of value with the intent to influence an official action. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h3>What Would it Take?</h3>
<p>A specific offer of money is not required to constitute a bribe. Simply posing a coded question, such as “What would it take?”, to a public official can be sufficient to constitute the crime of bribery. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Bribery</h2>
<p>The crime of Bribery is a Second Degree Felony in Florida and punishable by up to fifteen (15) years in prison, fifteen (15) years of probation, and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Bribery is assigned a Level 7 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. Absent grounds for a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence, a judge is required to sentence a person convicted of Bribery to a minimum sentence of 21 months in prison, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of 15 years in prison.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Bribery</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Bribery are:</p>
<h3>Generalized Expectation</h3>
<p>It is a defense to the crime of Bribery if it can be shown that there was no explicit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo">quid pro quo</a> in a donation to a public official.</p>
<p>Thus, a generalized expectation of some future favorable action is insufficient to convict someone one of bribery. Rather the public official must agree to take or forgo some specific act for there to be a crime. Absent such an agreement, even a close-in-time relationship between a donation and an act will not suffice. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Defrauding an Innkeeper in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">The crime of Defrauding an Innkeeper involves fraudulently obtaining food, lodging, or accommodations.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/509.151">Florida Statute 509.151</a>, the crime of Defrauding an Innkeeper occurs when a person obtains food, lodging, or accommodations at any public food service establishment, hotel, motel, or temporary lodging establishment with the intent to defraud the operator out of the value of the food, lodging, or accommodations.</p>
<p>Defrauding an Innkeeper differs from the crime of <a href="#theft/">theft</a>, in that theft involves the taking of property without permission, whereas an innkeeper voluntarily provides the food or lodging in advance, but with the expectation of later payment.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Defrauding an Innkeeper</h2>
<p>If the value of the food, lodging, or other accommodations is valued at less than $750, the crime is classified as <a href="#misdemeanor">misdemeanor Defrauding an Innkeeper</a>.</p>
<p>If the value of the food, lodging, or other accommodations is valued at $750 or more, the crime is classified as <a href="#felony">felony Defrauding an Innkeeper</a>.</p>
<h3 id="misdemeanor">Defrauding an Innkeeper of less than $750 in Value</h3>
<p>Defrauding an Innkeeper of less than $750 in Value is a Second Degree Misdemeanor in Florida and punishable by up to 60 days in jail, 60 days of probation, and a $500 fine.</p>
<p>If convicted of Defrauding an Innkeeper of less than $750 in Value, a judge may sentence a person to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of 60 days in jail.</p>
<h3 id="felony">Defrauding an Innkeeper of $750 or more in Value</h3>
<p>The crime of Defrauding an Innkeeper of $750 or more in Value is a Third Degree Felony in Florida and is punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Defrauding an Innkeeper of $750 or more in Value is assigned a Level 1 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.

<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Defrauding an Innkeeper include:</p>
<h3>Disputed Amount Owed</h3>
<p>The crux of the crime of Defrauding an Innkeeper is that a person intentionally attempts to defraud an innkeeper out of the value of the food, lodging, or accommodations provided.</p>
<p>However, if there is a good faith dispute as to the amount owed and the innkeeper refuses to accept the proffered payment, then there is no intent to defraud and no crime has occurred. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="Inedible Food">Inedible Food</h3>
<p>There is an implied covenant in every restaurant-patron transaction that the restaurant is only entitled to be paid, or retain payment, for food if the food served by the restaurant is edible. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>It is important to note that this covenant is based upon what would be “reasonably expected” by a consumer in the food served. Usually, this defense would be limited to instances where foreign or unexpected objects were discovered in the food or obvious signs of over or under cooking are present. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>

<blockquote class="half">Extortion is a Second Degree Felony in Florida.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/836.05">Florida Statute 836.05</a>, the crime of Extortion is committed when a person maliciously threatens to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accuse another of any crime or offense;</li>
<li>Injure the person, property or reputation of another;</li>
<li>Expose another to disgrace;</li>
<li>Expose any secret affecting another; or</li>
<li>Impute any deformity or lack of chastity to another.</li>
</ul>
<li>with the intent to:
						<ul>
<li>Extort money or any pecuniary advantage; or</li>
<li>Compel any person to do any act or refrain from doing any act against their will.</li>
</ul></li>
<h3>Actual Malice versus Legal Malice</h3>
<p>Although it is a subtle distinction, under the Extortion statute, the prosecutor is required to prove the threat was committed with Actual Malice, which means “means ill will, hatred, spite,  evil intent.” <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>This is in contrast to what is known as Legal Malice, which only requires that an act be committed intentionally and without any lawful justification.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Extortion</h2>
<p>The crime of Extortion is a Second Degree Felony in Florida and is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, 15 years of probation, and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Extortion is assigned a Level 6 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge may sentence a person convicted of Extortion to probation, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of 15 years in prison.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Extortion</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Extortion are:</p>
<h3>Idle Threats</h3>
<p>It is a defense to the crime of Extortion if it can be shown that the threat was never intended to actually reach the intended target and was just an idle threat.</p>
<p>An example would be if, in passing, you told a third-party you would expose a mutual friend’s affair unless he repaid a debt. Since the threat was not intended to be passed on, there was no crime of Extortion. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h3>Litigation Privilege</h3>
<p>Known as the Litigation Privilege, a lawyer may make written demands of another party without fear of being prosecuted or sued for extortion, even if these same demands would constitute the crime of extortion if made by the lawyer’s client.</p>
<p>The basis for this privilege is that a lawyer should be free to act on their own best judgment in prosecuting or defending a lawsuit without fear of later having to defend against an action for something said or written during the litigation. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>

<h3>Legal Efficacy</h3>
<p>To fall under the purview of the forgery statute, a document must have some legal efficacy, meaning it must have a legal significance that affects another person’s legal right to something. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small> As such, forging a love letter to someone will not constitute criminal forgery.</p>
<p>Statutory examples of a legal document include checks, deeds, wills, testaments, powers of attorney, insurance policies, bill of lading, promissory notes, receipts, passage tickets, and any documents that are required to be certified or notarized by law.</p>
<h3>Forging vs Uterring</h3>
<p>Forgery and <a href="#uttering_forged_instruments">Uttering Forged Instruments</a> are distinct and separate crimes.</p>
<p>Forgery criminalizes the creation of a forged document. Whereas <a href="#uttering_forged_instruments">Uttering Forged Instruments</a> criminalizes the distribution of the forged document.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Forgery</h2>
<p>The crime of Forgery is a Third Degree Felony in Florida and is punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Forgery is assigned a Level 1 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.

<h3>Intent to Defraud</h3>
<p>Forgery requires proof that a forged document was intended to be viewed as genuine.</p>
<h3>Patently Ridiculous Writings</h3>
<p>Forgeries of patently ridiculous documents, such as deeds to land on the moon, licenses to kill, or checks for a “Zillion” dollars do not qualify as having the ability to fool people and should not be considered criminal forgery.</p>

<p>Organized Fraud is punished more severely and is committed when a person actually obtains property pursuant to a scheme to defraud.</p>
<p>Unlike Communications Fraud, Organized Fraud does not require mail, telephonic, or electronic communications to have occurred as part of the scheme to defraud. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h4>Communications Fraud</h4>
<p>Communications Fraud is committed when a person engages in a scheme to defraud and, in furtherance of that scheme, communicates with another by mail, telephonic, or electronic means with the intent to obtain property fraudulently.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Scheme to Defraud</h2>
<p>The penalties for committing a Scheme to Defraud increase based upon the value of the property and whether the person scheme is considered <a href="#organized-fraud">Organized Fraud</a> or <a href="#communications-fraud">Communications Fraud</a>:</p>

<h3>Double Jeopardy</h3>
<p>As most Schemes to Defraud and theft offenses are considered degrees of the same core offense, only one conviction can be imposed if a person is charged with multiple theft and Scheme to Defraud offenses.

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Homicide in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Homicide is not always a crime, but the act of murder is.</blockquote>
<p>Homicide is defined as the killing of one human being by another human being.</p>
<p>Though the words homicide and murder are used synonymously, the truth is the act of homicide is not always a crime, but the act of murder is.</p>
<p>Florida divides the illegal killing of a person into two primary categories of crimes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Murder
								<ul>
<li><a href="#first_degree_murder">Murder in the First Degree</a></li>
<li><a href="#second_degree_murder">Murder in the Second Degree</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The presence of Malice is the distinguishing characteristic that separates the crime of Murder from the crime of Manslaughter. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>Under the crime of Murder, a defendant must have intended to kill the victim or killed the victim out of ill will, hatred, or spite.</p>
<p>Under the crime of Manslaughter, a defendant need only have killed a person by an intentionally negligent act (Voluntary Manslaughter) or a recklessly negligent act (Involuntary Manslaughter).</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Homicide</h2>
<p>The penalties for homicide depend on whether the death was the result of an intentional act, a reckless act, or a grossly dangerous act.</p>

<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to homicide crimes are:</p>
<h3>Excusable Homicide</h3>
<p>The killing of a human being is excusable, and therefore lawful, under any one of the following three circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the killing is committed by accident and misfortune in doing any lawful act by lawful means with usual ordinary caution and without any unlawful intent, or</li>
<li>When the killing occurs by accident and misfortune in the heat of passion, upon any sudden and sufficient provocation, or</li>
<li>When the killing is committed by accident and misfortune resulting from a sudden combat, if a dangerous weapon is not used and the killing is not done in a cruel or unusual manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Justifiable Homicide</h3>
<p>The killing of a human being is justifiable homicide and lawful if done while resisting an attempt by someone to kill you or to commit a felony against you.</p>
<h3>Self Defense</h3>
<p>Also known as the justified use of deadly force, self defense is a defense to the crime of First Degree Murder. Please view the section on <a href="#criminal_defenses_self_defense">Self Defense in Florida</a> for more information.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/782.071">Florida Statute 782.071</a>, the crime of Vehicular Homicide is committed when a person causes the death of another person while operating a motor vehicle in a reckless manner likely to cause death or great bodily harm.</p>
<p>The degree of culpability required to sustain a conviction for vehicular homicide is less than the degree of culpability necessary to prove <a href="#manslaughter">manslaughter</a>, but more than a mere failure to use ordinary care. <a href="#references"><small>[1]</small></a></p>
<p>The essential inquiry is whether the person knowingly drove a vehicle in such a manner and under such conditions as was likely to cause death or great bodily harm. <a href="#references"><small>[2]</small></a></p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Vehicular Homicide</h2>
<p>The crime of Vehicular Homicide is a Second Degree Felony in Florida and punishable by up to fifteen (15) years in prison, fifteen (15) years of probation, and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Vehicular Homicide is assigned a Level 7 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. Absent grounds for a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence, a judge is required to sentence a person convicted of Vehicular Homicide to a minimum sentence of 9¼ years in prison, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of fifteen (15) years in prison.</p>
<h3>Vehicular Homicide without Providing Information or Rendering Aid</h3>
<p>A person who commits Vehicular Homicide and also fails to provide their information or render aid at the scene commits the crime of Vehicular Homicide without Providing Information or Rendering Aid.</p>
<p>The crime of Vehicular Homicide without Providing Information or Rendering Aid is a First Degree Felony in Florida and punishable by up to thirty (30) years in prison, thirty (30) years of probation, and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Vehicular Homicide without Providing Information or Rendering Aid is assigned a Level 7 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. Absent grounds for a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence, a judge is required to sentence a person convicted of Vehicular Homicide without Providing Information or Rendering Aid to a minimum sentence of 9¼ years in prison, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of life in prison.</p>

<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Vehicular Homicide are:</p>
<h3>Simple Speeding</h3>
<p>Speeding, with nothing more, is insufficient to support a Vehicular Homicide conviction unless the speed is shown to be grossly excessive. <a href="#references"><small>[3]</small></a> </p>
<p>More commonly, other factors, such as poor weather or erratic driving, combined with speeding is necessary to support a Vehicular Homicide conviction.</p>

<h3>Police Officer</h3>
<p>The term police officer includes a municipal police officer or deputy sheriff or state trooper, a traffic crash investigation officer, a traffic infraction enforcement officer, or any member of the fire department at the scene of a fire, rescue operation, or other emergency.</p>

<h3 id="unlawful-order">Unlawful Order</h3>

<li>Makes an oath, by swearing or affirming to speak the truth;</li>
<li>And, while under oath, makes a false statement regarding a material matter;</li>
<li>That the person did not believe was true when it was made.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Nature of Proceedings</h3>
<p>As indicated below, the penalties for perjury differ depending on whether the perjurious statement was made in an Unofficial Proceeding, an Official Proceeding, or an Official Capital Prosecution Proceeding.</p>
<p>An “Official proceeding” means a proceeding heard before any legislative, judicial, administrative, or other governmental agency or official authorized to take evidence under oath.</p>
<p>This definition includes proceedings before any state attorney, referee, magistrate, administrative law judge, hearing officer, hearing examiner, commissioner, notary, or other person taking testimony or a deposition in connection with an official proceeding.</p>

<li><a href="#recantation">Recantation</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="materiality">Materiality</h3>
<p>Technically, under Florida law, materiality is not a defense, but a threshold issue that must be decided by a judge as a matter of law.</p>
<p>Consequently, if it can be shown the false statement did not relate to a material matter in the proceeding, the charge of perjury can be dismissed by the court without a trial.</p>
<h3 id="recantation">Recantation</h3>
<p>It is a defense to the crime of Perjury if the person making the false statement admits such statement to be false in the same continuous proceeding and</p>
<ol>
<li>The false statement has not substantially affected the proceeding; or</li>
<li>Such admission is made before it has become manifest that such false statement has been or will be exposed.</li>

<p>A judge may sentence a person convicted of Resisting Officer Without Violence to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of one (1) year in jail.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Resisting Officer Without Violence</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Resisting Officer Without Violence are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#excessive-force">Excessive force</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#unknown-status">Officer’s Status Unknown</a></li>
<li><a href="#protected-speech">Protected Speech</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#unlawful-arrest">Unlawful Arrest</a>;</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="excessive-force">Excessive Force</h3>
<p>A person is justified in the use of reasonable force to defend one’s self against an officer who uses excessive force to make an arrest or engages in police brutality. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>However, a person can only engage in self defense to the extent reasonably believed to be necessary. And the determination of whether the self defense was justified is based upon the circumstances at the time.</p>
<p>Additionally, the danger of excessive force or police brutality need not have been actual to justify a self-defense claim. In such instances, you are allowed to defend yourself if the appearance of excessive force or police brutality appeared to be imminent.</p>
<h3 id="unknown-status">Officer’s Status Unknown</h3>
<p>While a person may not use force to resist a police officer who is “known, or reasonably appears, to be a law enforcement officer.” A person accused of Resisting Officer Without Violence must have reason to know the “law enforcement officer” was actually an officer and not someone impersonating an officer. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="protected-speech">Protected Speech</h3>
<p>A person’s words alone will rarely, if ever, rise to the level of Resisting Officer Without Violence. Rather the words must usually be accompanied by obstructive physical conduct to support a conviction for Resisting Officer Without Violence. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="unlawful-arrest">Unlawful Arrest</h3>
<p>It is legal to passively resist an unlawful arrest, detention, or investigation. And the burden of demonstrating that the arrest was lawful falls upon the State.</p>
<h4>Lawful Arrest</h4>
<p>A lawful arrest is an arrest that is supported by probable cause. Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the officer’s knowledge are reasonable trustworthy and sufficient to warrant a reasonably cautious belief that an offense has been committed.</p>
<h4>Lawful Investigation</h4>
<p>A lawful investigation requires that the investigating officer have an articulable, reasonable suspicion that a person had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime before detaining the person to investigate the crime.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Resisting an Officer with Violence in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">It is unlawful to resist a person known to be a law enforcement officer with force.</blockquote>
<p>The crime of Resisting an Officer with Violence imposes heightened penalties on civilians who violently resist officers carrying out their public duties and is vigorously prosecuted by the State of Florida.</p>
<p>Importantly, unlike the crime of <a href="#resisting_officer_without_violence">Resisting an Officer Without Violence</a>, it is not a defense that an officer’s arrest was subsequently determined to be unlawful.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition of Resisting Officer with Violence</h2>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/843.01">Florida Statute 843.01</a>, the crime of Resisting Officer with Violence is committed when a person knowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or opposes a law enforcement officer by threatening violence or engaging in violent conduct against the law enforcement officer was engaged in the lawful execution of a legal duty.</p>
<h3>Law Enforcement Officer</h3>
<p>The term law enforcement officer includes a police officer, deputy sheriff, correctional officer, probation officer, or a person legally authorized to execute process (i.e. subpoenas or warrants).</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Resisting Officer with Violence</h2>
<p>The crime of Resisting an Officer with Violence is a Third Degree Felony in Florida and is punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and $5,000 in fines.</p>
<p>Resisting an Officer with Violence is assigned a Level 5 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge may sentence a person convicted of Resisting an Officer with Violence to probation, but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of five (5) years in prison.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Resisting Officer with Violence</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Resisting Officer with Violence are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#on-the-job">“On the Job”</a></li>
<li><a href="#self-defense">Self Defense</a></li>
<li><a href="#unknown-status">Officer’s Status Unknown</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="on-the-job">On The Job</h3>
<p>A conviction for Resisting an Officer with Violence requires proof that the officer was “engaged in the performance of a lawful duty when the resisting occurred,” not just “on the job.” <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>This requirement means that even if a uniformed law enforcement officer is working off duty for a bar, convenience store, as mall security, or for any private employer, they are merely “on the job” for the private employer and are not afforded enhanced protection under the statute. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>However, if while working for a private employer, they become engaged in “activities of an official police nature,” such as breaking up a fight, escorting a trespasser of the premises, or arresting someone, a person who then batters the officer is subject to being convicted of Battery on a Law Enforcement Officer.</p>
<h3 id="self-defense">Self Defense</h3>
<p>While a person cannot use violence to resist an arrest, even an unlawful arrest, a person may use reasonable force to resist the use of excessive force conducted during the arrest.</p>
<p>However, apart from an arrest scenario, a person is authorized to use reasonable force to defend themselves against other unlawful actions committed by law enforcement officers. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>Examples of unlawful actions that a person may defend against are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlawfully entering a private home;</li>
<li>Unlawfully frisking a person; or</li>
<li>Unlawfully detaining someone.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Nevertheless, regardless of whether an officer is engaged in unlawful activity, a person who uses force against an officer does so at his own risk; as the State Attorney’s Office will usually err on the side of the law enforcement officer when filing charges.</p>
<h4>Excessive Force</h4>
<p>If an officer uses excessive force when making an arrest, a person is justified in the use of reasonable force to defend himself or herself.</p>
<p>Additionally, the danger of excessive force or police brutality need not have been actual to justify a self-defense claim. In such instances, you are allowed to defend yourself if the appearance of excessive force or police brutality appeared to be imminent.</p>
<p>However, a person can only defend themselves to the extent reasonably believed that such force was necessary. And the determination of whether the resistance with violence was justified is based upon the circumstances at the time.</p>
<h3 id="unknown-status">Officer’s Status Unknown</h3>
<p>While a person is not justified in using force to resist a police officer who is “known, or reasonably appears to be a law enforcement officer.” A person accused of Battery on Law Enforcement Officer must have reason to know that the “victim” was actually an officer and not someone impersonating an officer. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>

<blockquote class="half">Human Trafficking is considered a form of modern day slavery and is aggressively prosecuted in Florida.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Human trafficking involves the sexual exploitation or forced labor of another person. Human Trafficking is considered a form of modern day slavery and is aggressively prosecuted in Florida.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition of Human Trafficking</h2>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/787.06">Florida Statute 787.06</a>, the crime of Human Trafficking is committed when a person knowingly, or in reckless disregard of the facts, engages in or financially benefits from transporting, soliciting, recruiting, harboring, providing, enticing, maintaining, or obtaining another person for the purpose of exploitation of that person for labor, services, or commercial sexual activity.</p>
<h3>Human Trafficking Victims: Adult-Child Distinctions</h3>
<p>If an adult is alleged to have been a victim of human trafficking, the prosecutor must prove that the adult victim was coerced into performing labor, services, or commercial sexual activity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a child is alleged to have been a victim of human trafficking, the prosecutor does not need to prove that the child was coerced into performing labor, services, or commercial sexual activity.</p>
<p>As a result, simply exploiting a child for the purpose of labor, services, or commercial sexual activity would support a Human Trafficking conviction.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Human Trafficking</h2>
<p>The minimum and maximum penalties for Human Trafficking increase based upon whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>coercion was used during the human trafficking;</li>
<li>the human trafficking was for labor and services or commercial sexual activity; or</li>
<li>the human trafficking victim was a child, unauthorized alien, or mentally impaired person.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Human Trafficking for Labor or Services or Commercial Sexual Activity</h3>
<p>The crime of Human Trafficking for Labor or Services or Commercial Sexual Activity is a First Degree Felony and is assigned either a Level 7, 8, or 9 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.</p>
<p>If convicted of Human Trafficking for Labor or Services or Commercial Sexual Activity, a judge is required to impose a minimum sentence of approximately 21 months in prison absent grounds to impose a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence and can also impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to thirty (30) years in prison.</li>
<li>Up to thirty (30) years of probation.</li>
<li>Up to $10,000 in fines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Human Trafficking of a Child or Mentally Defective Person for Commercial Sexual Activity</h3>
<p>The crime of Human Trafficking of a Child or Mentally Defective Person for Commercial Sexual Activity is a Life Felony and is assigned a Level 10 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.</p>
<p>If convicted of Human Trafficking, a judge is required to impose a minimum sentence of approximately 66 months in prison absent grounds to impose a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence and can also impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to Life in prison.</li>
<li>Up to Life on probation.</li>
<li>Up to $10,000 in fines.</li>

<p>It is a defense to the crime of Human Trafficking for Commercial Sexual Activity if it can be shown that the victim was voluntarily engaged in <a href="#prostitution/">prostitution</a> and had not been exploited or coerced into engaging in the <a href="#prostitution/">prostitution</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, a person who hired a prostitute from a classified ad would not be guilty of Human Trafficking, although they would likely be guilty of <a href="#prostitution_solicitation_of_prostitution">Solicitation of Prostitution</a>.</p>
<p>Likewise, a person who formed a business partnership with a prostitute might not be guilty of Human Trafficking for Commercial Sexual Activity, although they would likely be guilty of the lesser crime of <a href="#prostitution_deriving_support_from_proceeds_of_prostitution">Deriving Support from the Proceeds of Prostitution</a>.</p>

Rather, it is the intentional confinement of a victim, not their incidental movement, that justifies the kidnapping conviction. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>As a result, someone who holds up a convenience store clerk cannot be convicted of Kidnapping by telling someone to stand in a certain spot. (However, they could be convicted of <a href="#false_imprisonment">False Imprisonment</a>.)</p>

<h3>Legitimate Publication</h3>
<p>It is lawful to publish a sexually explicit image of another person in furtherance of a legitimate purpose. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>

<h3>Unreasonable Distress</h3>
<p>Publishing a sexually explicit image of another person that would not cause the a reasonable person substantial emotional distress, does not constitute the crime of Sexual Harassment.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/384.24">Florida Statute 384.24</a>, the crime of Unlawful Sexual Intercourse with <abbr title="Sexually Transmissible Disease">STD</abbr> is committed when a person, who is knowingly infected with a specified sexually transmissible disease and has been informed they could transmit the disease to another person, engages in sexual intercourse with another person without obtaining informed consent to engage in sexual intercourse notwithstanding the presence of the sexually transmitted disease.</p>
<h3>Informed Consent</h3>
<p>Prior to having sexual intercourse with another person, an infected person must inform the other person of the presence of the sexually transmissible disease and obtain consent from the other person before engaging in sexual intercourse.</p>
<h3>Knowledge of Infection</h3>
<p>Knowledge of an infection can be shown through either actual knowledge or construction knowledge. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h4>Actual Knowledge</h4>
<p>A person will have actual knowledge if he or she has been formally diagnosed with a sexually transmissible disease by a medical professional.</p>
<h4>Constructive Knowledge</h4>
<p>A person will have constructive knowledge if he or she has experienced the obvious symptoms of the specified sexually transmissible disease — such as rashes, genital warts, or discharge.</p>
<h3>Sexual Intercourse</h3>
<p>Sexual intercourse includes more than the traditional act of a male placing his penis inside a female’s vagina, but also encompasses oral and anal sexual activity between men, woman, or both. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>

<h3>Ignorance of Infection</h3>
<p>Absent actual or constructive knowledge of an infection, simply being a promiscuous person would not constitute knowledge of an <abbr title="Sexually Transmissible Disease">STD</abbr> infection.</p>
<p>Meaning, that although a person may have a moral obligation to be forthcoming about their past sexual history, they are under no legal obligation to either discover whether they have a <abbr title="Sexually Transmissible Disease">STD</abbr> (unless they have exhibited signs of an <abbr title="Sexually Transmissible Disease">STD</abbr>) or tell a potential sexual partner about their past sexual history before engaging in sexual intercourse.</p>

<blockquote class="half">Deriving Support from the Proceeds of Prostitution is committed when a person lives off of another person’s prostitution proceeds.</blockquote>
<p>Once relegated to the shadows of seedy sections of Central Florida, prostitution has become increasingly common due to the ease with which “escorts” and sex workers can be found on the internet.</p>
<p>As a result, the legislature has focused their efforts on punishing ”pimps“ who derive any portion of their income off of another person’s prostitution related proceeds.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition of Deriving Support from Proceeds of Prostitution</h2>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/796.05">Florida Statute 796.05</a>, the crime of Deriving Support from the Proceeds of Prostitution is committed when a person lives off of, derives support from, or maintains any part of their lifestyle from what is reasonably believed to be, or known to be, the earnings or proceeds of another person’s performance of prostitution.</p>
<h3>Reasonable Belief</h3>
<p>Often, pimps, escort services, or “marketing assistants” will post internet advertisements on behalf of women with a disclaimer stating that whatever occurs is between two consenting adults, the companionship or escort service was not for prostitution, or some other variation.</p>
<p>Such self-serving statements attempting to deny knowledge that sex will occur between the prostitute and customer will not, as a matter of law, serve as a defense to the crime of Deriving Support from the Proceeds of Prostitution.

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/562.111">Florida Statute 562.111</a>, the crime of Possession of Alcohol by a Minor occurs if a person under the age of 21 is found in possession of alcoholic beverages.</p>
<h3>Definition of Alcoholic Beverages</h3>
<p>An alcoholic beverage is defined as any distilled spirit or beverage containing one-half of 1 percent or more alcohol by volume. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Possession of Alcohol by a Minor</h2>
<p>Possession of Alcohol by a Minor is an enhanceable offense, which means that the maximum possible penalties increase if a person has been previously convicted of Possession of Alcohol by a Minor.</p>
<h3>First Offense Penalties</h3>
<p>A first offense Possession of Alcohol by a Minor is a Second Degree Misdemeanor.</p>
<p>If convicted of Possession of Alcohol by a Minor, a judge can impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to 60 days in jail.</li>
<li>Up to 6 months probation.</li>
<li>Up to $500 in fines.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Mandatory Driver License Suspension</h4>
<p>If found guilty of Possession of Alcohol by a Minor, the court is required to revoke your driver’s license for a minimum of six months. The court also has the authority to increase this suspension to 12 months.</p>
<h3>Subsequent Offense Penalties</h3>
<p>Possession of Alcohol by a Minor with a prior conviction is a First Degree Misdemeanor.</p>
<p>If convicted of Possession of Alcohol by a Minor with a prior conviction, a judge can impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>
<ul>

<li>Up to 12 months of probation.</li>
<li>Up to $1,000 in fines.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Mandatory Driver License Suspension</h4>
<p>If found guilty of Possession of Alcohol by a Minor with a prior conviction, the court is required to revoke your driver’s license for two years.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Possession of Alcohol by a Minor</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Possession of Alcohol by a Minor are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</a></li>

<li><a href="#overdose-defense">Overdose Defense</a></li>
<li><a href="#temporary-possession">Temporary Possession</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h3>
<p>If the alcohol was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have to comply with the law of constructive possession, which requires the prosecutor to prove the following three elements before you can be convicted of Possession of Alcohol by a Minor: <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the alcohol’s presence;</li>
<li>Knowledge of the illicit nature of the alcohol; and</li>
<li>Exercised dominion and control over the alcohol.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it can be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive Possession of Alcohol by a Minor.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police find a plastic cup with beer in the cup holder, they would be unable to convict you of Possession of Alcohol by a Minor unless they had some proof that you knew the cup contained alcohol.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend takes places a six-pack of beer by his feet. The police then stop you, see your friend’s six-pack, and arrest both of you. They should be unable to convict you of Possession of Alcohol by a Minor because even though you knew the beer was there, your friend is the only person who exercised dominion and control over it.</blockquote>
<h3 id="lawfully-employed-service-employee">Lawfully Employed Service Employee</h3>
<p>It is lawful, and therefore a defense to the crime of Possession of Alcohol by a Minor, for a person over the age of 18, to possess (but not consume) alcoholic beverage in the scope of his or her employment.</p>
<h3 id="non-alcoholic-beverage">Non-Alcoholic Beverage</h3>
<p>Pursuant to Florida Statute 561.01(4)(a), a beverage is only considered to be alcoholic if it contains one-half of 1 percent or more alcohol by total volume. If the beverage contains less than this amount, the beverage is considered non-alcoholic, which is legal for a minor to possess.</p>
<p>Consequently, if possession of a mixed-drink was the basis of the charge and law enforcement failed to secure the entire drink as evidence, it would be impossible to prove the composition of the drink was 1 percent or more alcohol by total volume.</p>
<h3 id="overdose-defense">Overdose Defense</h3>
<p>A person who is experiencing a drug or alcohol related overdose that needs medical assistance, or a person assisting the person that needs medical assistance, is immune from prosecution for amy alcohol related offense if it can be shown the evidence was obtained as a result of the overdose and need for medical assistance. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="temporary-possession">Temporary Possession</h3>
<p>The defense of temporary possession can be raised where a minor takes momentary, temporary, or transitory possession of alcohol from another person. Under such circumstances, the minor is not considered to be in legal possession of the alcoholic beverage because the minor never exercised complete dominion and control over the alcohol. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<p>Examples of temporary possession are when a minor is handed alcohol by another person and asked to hide it (usually during an unexpected police encounter); or when being handed alcohol by an adult for the sole purpose of tasting it; or when passing the alcohol from one person to another person.</p>

<h3>First Offense Penalties</h3>
<p>A first offense Providing Alcohol to a Minor is a Second Degree Misdemeanor.</p>
<p>If convicted of Providing Alcohol to a Minor, a judge can impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Contracting Without a License in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Contracting Without a License is a First Degree Misdemeanor in Florida.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/489.127">Florida Statute 489.127</a>, the crime of Contracting Without a License is committed when a person engages in the business of contracting for compensation without being properly licensed in the State of Florida.</p>
<h3>Activities Requiring a Contractor’s License</h3>
<p>In Florida, a person must possess a contractor’s license to perform the following activities for compensation. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising, marketing, or bidding out contracting services.</li>
<li>Building and home remodeling;</li>
<li>Building and home repairs;</li>
<li>Demolition;</li>
<li>New construction; and</li>
<li>Related real estate improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General Contractor vs. Specialized Contractor</h3>
<p>A general contractor may perform any activity requiring licensure as a contractor under Chapter 489. However, a specialized contractor may only perform those contracting activities they are specifically licensed for.</p>
<p>Examples of specialized contractors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building Contractor</li>
<li>Residential Contractor</li>
<li>Class A, B or C Air Conditioning Contractor</li>
<li>Mechanical Contractor</li>
<li>Plumbing Contractor</li>
<li>Pollutant Storage Systems Contractor</li>
<li>Roofing Contractor</li>
<li>Sheet Metal Contractor</li>
<li>Solar Contractor</li>
<li>Swimming Pool/Spa Contractor
						<ul>
<li>Commercial Pool/Spa Contractor</li>
<li>Residential Pool/Spa Contractor</li>
<li>Servicing Contractor</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Underground Utility and Excavation Contractor</li>
<h3>Contractor’s License</h3>
<p>In Florida, every contractor, whether a general contractor or a specialized contractor, must possess either a certified contractor’s license issued by the <a href="http://www.myfloridalicense.com/DBPR/">Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation</a> (DBPR), or a registered contractor’s license issued by the specific municipality where the contracting work is being performed.</p>
<h4>Certified Contractor’s License</h4>
<p>A certified contractor’s license is issued by the Florida <abbr title="Department of Business and Professional Regulation">DBPR</abbr> and allows a contractor to work anywhere in Florida.</p>
<h4>Registered Contractor’s License</h4>
<p>A registered contractor’s license is issued by specific municipalities and a person is only allowed to perform contracting work in the municipality that issued the registered contractor’s license.</p>
<p>Importantly, a registered contractor’s license is not the same thing as an occupational license. An occupational license simply shows you registered to conduct business in a municipality, it does not mean the municipality authorized you to perform contracting work.</p>
<p>A registered contractor’s license shows you are proficient in the field of contracting and the municipality specifically authorized you to perform contracting work within their jurisdiction.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Contracting Without a License</h2>
<p>The crime of Contracting Without a License is a First Degree Misdemeanor.</p>
<p>If convicted of Contracting Without a License in Florida, a judge can impose up to one (1) year in jail, one (1) year of probation, or $1,000 in fines in addition to any civil penalties imposed by the Florida <abbr title="Department of Business and Professional Regulation">DBPR</abbr>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a person who engages in contracting without a license and falsely asserts they are properly licensed can also be convicted of theft if they received payment for their contracting services. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h3>Contracting Without a License with a Prior Conviction</h3>
<p>Contracting Without a License after having been previously been convicted of Contracting without a License is a Third Degree Felony, which is assigned a Level 1 offense severity ranking under Florida’s Criminal Punishment Code.</p>
<p>If convicted of Contracting without a License with a prior conviction in Florida, a judge can impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to five (5) years in prison.</li>
<li>Up to five (5) years of probation.</li>
<li>Up to $5,000 in fines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contracting Without a License During a State of Emergency</h3>
<p>Contracting Without a License During a State of Emergency is a Third Degree Felony, which is assigned a Level 1 offense severity ranking under Florida’s Criminal Punishment Code.</p>
<p>If convicted of Contracting Without a License During a State of Emergency in Florida, a judge can impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to five (5) years in prison.</li>
<li>Up to five (5) years of probation.</li>
<li>Up to $5,000 in fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Contracting Without a License</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Contracting Without a License are:</p>
<h3>Uncompensated Assistance</h3>
<p>So long as a person is not compensated in any way, a person may assist another person in constructing, repairing, altering, remodeling, demolishing, or improving, any building or structure without being licensed.</p>
<p>A typical example would be if a person assisted a neighbor in building an addition to the neighbor’s home. So long as the person was not compensated in any way for their work, they would not be committing Unlicensed Contracting.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Florida Sex Crimes Defenses</h1>
<blockquote class="half">The best defense against a sex crime is to gather exculpatory evidence...</blockquote>
<p>Sex crimes are unique because the law heavily favors the accuser. As a result, an accuser’s past sexual history, mental health, or previous false accusations is not always admissible.</p>
<p>Therefore, the best defense against a sexual accusation is a good offense, which is to gather exculpatory evidence that calls into question the accuser’s motives and credibility and that supports your innocence. </p>
<p>You may wonder why you must “prove your innocence” if the law presumes you “innocent until proven guilty.” The answer is simple; you don’t – but common sense dictates that you do so if you want to persuade the prosecution not to file charges, or a jury to acquit you.</p>
<p>It is always easier to persuade a prosecutor not to file charges because of conflicting evidence, than it is to persuade a prosecutor to dismiss charges they already filed.</p>
<h2>Pre-Filing Investigation</h2>
<p>Pre-Filing investigation yields tremendously useful information. If I obtain the information before charges have been filed I can present it to the prosecutor to show them they have a weak case that should not be pursued; as it is always easier to persuade a prosecutor not to file charges because of conflicting evidence, than it is to persuade a prosecutor to dismiss charges they have already filed.</p>
<p>Importantly, if the pre-filing investigation does not yield helpful information, I can develop a more appropriate defense strategy based upon the findings.</p>
<p>Pre-filing investigation involves two major components:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#investigate-accuser">Investigating the Accuser</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="#exculpatory-evidence">Gathering Exculpatory Evidence</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="investigate-accuser">Investigating the Accuser</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, false allegations of sexual misconduct are increasingly common in Florida courts and one of the primary reasons people find themselves being accused of a sex crimes.</p>
<p>Many an estranged parent or boyfriend (typically) finds themselves struggling with false allegations of sex abuse, molestations, or physical abuse. To compound the problem, law enforcement rarely disbelieves an accuser; and that is why it is so important to identify a possible motive to lie as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Typical reasons for false allegations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jealousy,</li>
<li>Manipulation of children by an angry parent, or</li>
<li>Mentally ill parents influencing a child</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exculpatory-evidence">Gathering Exculpatory Evidence</h3>
<p>Gathering exculpatory evidence is one of the best ways that you can keep a prosecutor from filing charges. Three of the primary tools I use to obtain exculpatory evidence are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#investigator">Private Investigator</a></li>
<li><a href="#polygraph">Confidential Polygraph Examination</a></li>
<li><a href="#psycho-sexual">Confidential Psycho-Sexual Examination</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="investigator">Private Investigator</h4>
<p>Once a person accuses you of a crime, it is important to find out as much information as possible about nature of their accusation. This includes </p>
<ul>
<li>When did they say it happened?</li>
<li>Where did they say it happened? </li>
<li>Was there any communication devices involved? </li>
<li>Whom did they confide in?</li>
<li>Have they made any conflicting statements?</li>
<li>The list goes on...</li>
</ul>
<p>I routinely utilize a private investigator to locate witnesses, documents, or records that can answer these questions and hopefully find inconsistencies in the accuser’s account or time line that show they are fabricating their claims or falsifying the nature of their encounter with you.</p>
<h4 id="polygraph">Confidential Polygraph Examination</h4>
<p>I advise almost all my clients to submit to a confidential polygraph examination. There are several reasons for this. Primarily though, while a polygraph examination may not be admissible in court, it is persuasive to prosecutors. So if the polygraph suggests you are truthful about your innocence, a prosecutor will be less likely to pursue charges against you on a weak case.</p>
<p>Additionally, if the results show you as being deceptive, I do not disclose the polygraph results to anyone. Instead I use the knowledge I gained to plot a more appropriate defense to your case.</p>
<h4 id="psycho-Sexual">Confidential Psycho-Sexual Evaluation</h4>
<p>I also advise all clients facing a sex crime to submit to a Psycho-Sexual Evaluation. While a psychosexual evaluation cannot assess guilt or innocence; it is helpful in determining if a client has any sexually deviant tendencies, thoughts, or beliefs.</p>
<p>If the evaluation suggests you are normal, I can submit the results to the prosecutor and argue that the evaluation’s independent results are inconsistent with the charges being leveled against you.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the results show you do suffer from a sexually deviant tendency or they come back inconclusive, I can use the information to chart a more appropriate defense for you that avoids exposing you to unnecessary scrutiny.</p>

<p>Under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>, Failure to Register as a Sexual Offender is assigned a Level 7 offense severity ranking and, absent prior criminal history or grounds for a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence, a judge is required to sentence a person convicted of Failure to Register as a Sexual Offender to a minimum sentence of 21 months in prison.</p>
<h3>Impact of Prior Criminal Record</h3>
<p>Since a sexual offender or sexual predator must have been convicted of a sexual offense to qualify as a sexual offender or predator in the first place, a judge is often required to sentence a person convicted of Failure to Register as a Sexual Offender to an even higher minimum prison sentence than 21 months in prison under Florida’s Criminal Punishment Code.</p>

Under such a circumstance, the reporting date will fall on the next business day the offender registration office, sheriff’s office, or DHSMV office is open for business. <small><a href="#references">[5]</a></small></p>
<h3>Misinformation or Prevention by Law Enforcement</h3>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Florida’s Sexual Offenses</h1>
<p itemprop="description">Florida classifies sexual crimes into three primary offense categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="#sexual_battery">Sexual Battery or Rape</a>,
				</li>
<li>
<a href="#statutory-rape">Unlawful Sexual Activity with Minors or Statutory Rape</a>, and
				</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h2 id="statutory-rape">Unlawful Sexual Activity with Minors (Statutory Rape)
				<br/>(Florida Statute 794.05)</h2>
<p>Unlawful Sexual Activity with Certain Minors (Statutory rape) makes it illegal for a person 24 or older to have sexual intercourse with a 16 or 17 year old, even if both parties consent to the sexual conduct. Importantly, ignorance of the victim’s age is irrelevant as a defense to the charge, even if the victim lied about his or her age or the accused had a bona fide belief the victim was old enough to give consent.</p>
<p>However, it is legal for a person who is between the age of twenty-three and sixteen (23 - 16) to have sex with a person who is sixteen (16) or seventeen (17) years old. </p>
<p>A person convicted of Unlawful Sexual Activity (Statutory Rape) would be facing a maximum sentence of fifteen (15) years in prison and a minimum sentence of approximately seven (5) years in prison. Additionally, they would be declared a sexual offender and would be forced to comply with sexual offender registration laws throughout Florida and the United States.</p>
<h2 id="lewd-acts">Lewd or Lascivious Acts; Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Person under Sixteen (Florida Statute 800.04(4) - (7))</h2>
<p>Lewd or Lascivious Acts are any offenses committed in a lewd or lascivious manner (sexual manner) on a person younger than sixteen. There are two important points that apply to any lewd and lascivious offense.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ignorance of the victim’s age can not be raised as a defense to the charge,</li>
<li>The Age of the accused is not a defense; meaning that if a 12 year-old were to have sex with a 14 year-old, either child or both could be prosecuted for the offense.</li>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Lewd or Lascivious Battery in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Lewd or Lascivious Battery criminalizes consensual sexual intercourse with a child.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">In Florida, Lewd or Lascivious Battery, more commonly known as statutory rape, criminalizes consensual sexual intercourse with a child older than 12, but younger than 16.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/800.04">Florida Statute 800.04(4)</a>, the crime of Lewd or Lascivious Battery is committed when a person:</p>
<ul>
<li>engages in sexual activity with a child older than 12, but younger than 16; or</li>
<li>encourages, forces, or entices a child older than 12, but younger than 16, to engage in sadomasochistic abuse, sexual bestiality, prostitution, or any other act involving sexual activity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strict Liability Crime</h3>
<p>Lewd or Lascivious Battery is a strict liability crime, meaning ignorance of the child’s age is not a defense.</p>
<p>The reason Lewd and Lascivious Battery is a strict liability crime is to counteract the commonly raised defenses that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The child’s real age was unknown, thus making the sexual activity with the child unintentional; or</li>
<li>The child consented to the sexual act, thus putting the responsibility to decline the sexual advance on the child.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Lewd or Lascivious Battery</h2>
<p>The crime of Lewd and Lascivious Battery is a Second Degree Felony punishable by up to fifteen years in prison, fifteen years of <a href="#criminal_probation_sex_offender_probation">sex offender probation</a>, and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>, Lewd and Lascivious Battery is assigned a Level 8 offense severity ranking and, absent prior criminal history or grounds for a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence, a judge is required to sentence a person convicted of Lewd and Lascivious Battery to a minimum sentence of 7¾ years in prison followed by at least two years of <a href="#criminal_probation_sex_offender_probation">sex offender probation</a>. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>A person sentenced to prison for Lewd or Lascivious Battery is ineligible for gain time and must serve the entirety of their prison sentence, day-for-day. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="civil-consequences">Civil Consequences</h3>
<p>A person convicted of Lewd and Lascivious Battery would not only be placed on <a href="#criminal_probation_sex_offender_probation">sex offender probation</a>, but would also be designated a sexual offender.</p>
<p>As a result, the person would be required to comply with sexual offender registration laws in Florida and throughout the United States for the remainder of their lives.</p>
<h4>Romeo and Juliet Exception</h4>
<p>The only exception to the mandatory sex offender designation is if the person falls under Florida’s “<a href="#romeo_juliet_law">Romeo and Juliet</a>” law.</p>
<p>This law allows certain individuals to petition the court to be excluded from the sex offender registry. However, you can only petition for exclusion if the facts of your crime meet very specific <a href="romeo-juliet-law.html#eligibility-requirements">eligibility requirements</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mitigating-circumstances">Mitigating Circumstances</h3>
<p>Under certain circumstances, the court can deviate from the minimum prison sentence required under Florida’s sentencing guidelines if it can be shown:</p>
<ul>
<li>The child was an initiator, willing participant, aggressor, or provoker of the incident;</li>
<li>The defendant requires specialized treatment for a mental disorder (unrelated to substance abuse or addiction) and is amenable to treatment; or</li>
<li>The defendant is to be sentenced as a youthful offender before the defendant’s 21st birthday.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Lewd or Lascivious Battery</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, evidence of false allegations remains the most effective defense to raise when charged with Lewd and Lascivious Battery.</p>
<h3>False Allegations</h3>
<p>Typical reasons for false allegations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jealousy,</li>
<li>Manipulation of children by an angry parent,</li>
<li>Mental illness of the accuser, or</li>
<li>Mentally ill parents influencing a child.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it is critically important to investigate the accuser and expose any motive that may exist for making a false accusation of Lewd or Lascivious Battery.</p>
<h2 id="prohibited-defenses">Prohibited Defenses to Lewd or Lascivious Battery</h2>
<p>Because Lewd or Lascivious Battery is a strict liability crime, the following defenses are statutorily prohibited from being raised at trial:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#consent">Consent</a></li>
<li><a href="#ignorance">Ignorance of the child’s age</a></li>
<li><a href="#proximity">Proximity in Age</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="consent">Consent</h3>
<p>Consent by the child to the alleged sexual act is a statutorily prohibited defense - meaning it cannot even be argued at trial.</p>
<h3 id="ignorance">Ignorance of the Child’s Age</h3>
<p>Ignorance of the child’s age is also a statutorily prohibited defense to the crime of Lewd or Lascivious Battery - meaning it cannot be presented at trial.</p>
<p>This means a defendant cannot admit to the Lewd or Lascivious Battery, but argue that the crime of Lewd or Lascivious Battery was justified because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The child lied about his or her age; or</li>
<li>There was a bona fide belief the child was old enough to consent to the Lewd or Lascivious Battery.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that said, if it is being argued that the allegation of Lewd or Lascivious Battery is false; a defendant can elicit testimony that the accuser lied about his or her age - as such testimony goes to the accuser’s credibility.</p>
<h3 id="proximity">Proximity in Age</h3>
<p>A reoccurring problem in Lewd and Lascivious Battery cases is when the accused is also under the age of 16; as the law does not provide for any defense when the participants are close in age.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If a 12 year-old were to have sex with a 14 year-old, either child or both could be prosecuted for the offense.</p>
<p>Instead, proximity in age can only be used as a mitigating circumstance to seek a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure sentence</a> under Florida’s sentencing guidelines.</p>

<h3 id="civil-consequences">Civil Consequences</h3>
<p>A person convicted of Lewd and Lascivious Exhibition would not only be placed on <a href="#criminal_probation_sex_offender_probation">sex offender probation</a>, but would also be declared a sexual offender.</p>
<p>As a result, they would be required to comply with sexual offender registration laws in Florida and throughout the United States for the remainder of their lives.</p>
<h4>Romeo and Juliet Exception</h4>
<p>The only exception to the mandatory sex offender designation is if the person falls under Florida’s “<a href="#romeo_juliet_law">Romeo and Juliet</a>” law.</p>
<p>This law allows certain individuals to petition the court to be excluded from the sex offender registry. However, you can only petition for exclusion if the facts of your crime meet very specific <a href="romeo-juliet-law.html#eligibility-requirements">eligibility requirements</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mitigating-circumstances">Mitigating Circumstances</h3>
<p>Under certain circumstances, the court can deviate from the minimum prison sentence required under Florida’s sentencing guidelines if it can be shown:</p>
<ul>
<li>The child was an initiator, willing participant, aggressor, or provoker of the incident;</li>
<li>The defendant requires specialized treatment for a mental disorder (unrelated to substance abuse or addiction) and is amenable to treatment; or</li>
<li>The defendant is to be sentenced as a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_youthful_offender">youthful offender</a> before the defendant’s 21st birthday.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Lewd or Lascivious Exhibition</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, the two primary defenses to the crime of Lewd and Lascivious Exhibition are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#false-allegations">False Allegation</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="#lack-of-lewd-intent">Lack of Lewd Intent</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="false-allegations">False Allegations</h3>
<p>Typical reasons for false allegations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jealousy,</li>
<li>Manipulation of children by an angry parent,</li>
<li>Mental illness of the accuser, or</li>
<li>Mentally ill parents influencing a child.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lack-of-lewd-intent">Lack of Lewd Intent</h3>
<p>It is a defense to the charge of Lewd and Lascivious Exhibition if it can be shown there was no intent to expose the child to the sexual performance or sexual exposure that occurred.</p>
<h2 id="prohibited-defenses">Prohibited Defenses to Lewd or Lascivious Exhibition</h2>
<p>Because Lewd or Lascivious Exhibition is a strict liability crime, the following defenses are statutorily prohibited from being raised at trial:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#consent">Consent</a></li>
<li><a href="#ignorance">Ignorance of the child’s age</a></li>
<li><a href="#proximity">Proximity in Age</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="consent">Consent</h3>
<p>Consent by the child to the alleged sexual exhibition is a statutorily prohibited defense - meaning it cannot even be argued at trial.</p>
<h3 id="ignorance">Ignorance of the Child’s Age</h3>
<p>Ignorance of the child’s age is also a statutorily prohibited defense to the crime of Lewd or Lascivious Exhibition - meaning it cannot be argued at trial.</p>
<p>This means a defendant cannot admit to the Lewd or Lascivious Exhibition, but argue that the act of Lewd or Lascivious Exhibition was justified because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The child lied about his or her age; or</li>
<li>There was a bona fide belief the child was old enough to consent to the Lewd or Lascivious Exhibition.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that said, if it is being argued that the allegation of Lewd or Lascivious Exhibition is false; a defendant can elicit testimony that the accuser lied about his or her age - as such testimony goes to the accuser’s credibility.</p>
<h3 id="proximity">Proximity in Age</h3>
<p>A reoccurring problem in Lewd and Lascivious Exhibition cases is when the accused is also under the age of 16; as the law does not provide for any defense when the participants are close in age.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If a 12 year-old and a 14 year-old were to engage in mutual sexual exhibition, either child or both could be prosecuted for the offense.</p>
<p>Instead, proximity in age can only be used as a <a href="#mitigating-circumstances">mitigating circumstance</a> to seek a downward departure from Florida’s sentencing guidelines.</p>

<p>Lewd or Lascivious Molestation criminalizes consensual sexual interaction with a child younger than 16 that falls short of <a href="#lewd_or_lascivious_battery">lewd or lascivious battery</a>.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition of Lewd or Lascivious Molestation</h2>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/800.04">Florida Statute 800.04(5)</a>, the crime of Lewd or Lascivious Molestation is committed when a person intentionally touches the breasts, genitals, or buttocks of a child younger than 16 in a lewd or lascivious manner; or encourages, forces, or entices a child younger than 16 to touch another person in a lewd or lascivious manner.</p>
<h3>Definition of “Lewd or Lascivious”</h3>
<p>The words “lewd” and “lascivious” are synonymous (mean the same thing) and are defined as a wicked, lustful, unchaste, licentious, or sensual intent on the part of the person doing an act.</p>
<h3>Strict Liability Crime</h3>
<p>Lewd or Lascivious Molestation is a strict liability crime.</p>
<p>The reason Lewd and Lascivious Molestation is a strict liability crime is to counteract the commonly raised defenses that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The child’s real age was unknown, thus the sexual activity with the child was unintentional; or</li>
<li>That the child consented to the sexual act, thus putting the responsibility to decline the sexual advance on the young child.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Lewd or Lascivious Molestation</h2>

<li>Mental illness of the accuser, or</li>
<li>Mentally ill parents influencing a child.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lack-of-lewd-intent">Lack of Lewd Intent</h3>
<p>The core of the offense of Lewd and Lascivious Molestation is a lewd or lascivious intent. As a result, it is a defense to the charge of Lewd and Lascivious Molestation if it can be shown there was no lewd or lascivious intent when engaging in the contact.</p>
<h2 id="prohibited-defenses">Prohibited Defenses to Lewd or Lascivious Battery</h2>

<p>Ignorance of the child’s age is also a statutorily prohibited defense to the crime of Lewd or Lascivious Battery - meaning it cannot be presented at trial.</p>

<li><a href="#sexual-battery">Sexual Battery and Rape</a></li>
<li><a href="#sex-with-minors">Unlawful Sex with Minors</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="lewd-or-lascivious-acts">Lewd or Lascivious Acts</h2>

<li><a href="#lewd_or_lascivious_molestation">Lewd and Lascivious Molestation</a></li>

<p>There are two important points that apply to any lewd and lascivious offenses.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ignorance of the victim’s age can not be raised as a defense to any lewd and lascivious crime; and</li>
<li>The Age of the accused is not a defense; meaning if a 12 year-old were to have sex with a 14 year-old, either child, or both children, could be prosecuted for a lewd and lascivious crime.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sexual-battery">Sexual Battery or Rape</h2>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Florida Sex Crimes Penalties</h1>
<p>In addition to the regular consequences a criminal conviction carries, a person convicted of a sexually related felony offense is looking at the following additional sanctions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#general">Penalties for all Sex Crimes</a></li>
<li><a href="#specific">Penalties for Specific Sex Crimes</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general">General Sex Crimes Penalties</h2>
<h3>Sex Offender Designation</h3>
<p itemprop="description">Every person convicted of a sexually related felony offense is declared a sexual offender and is forced to comply with sexual offender registration laws throughout Florida and the United States.</p>
<p>Sex offenders must update their residence with every three to six months for their entire life.</p>
<h3>Incarceration</h3>
<p>Every sexually related felony offense scores mandatory prison.</p>
<h3>Sex Offender Probation</h3>
<p>Every person sexually convicted of a sexually related felony offense is placed on Sex Offender Probation; which restricts where you can live, imposes a curfew, requires mandatory sex offender counseling, and restricts where you can work.</p>
<h3>“Jimmy Ryce” Civil Commitment Proceedings</h3>
<p>Once convicted of a sexually motivated crime, the State Attorney can seek to have an imprisoned sex offender “committed” to a civil commitment facility upon the completion of the “criminal” prison sentence. This process essentially keeps a person locked up, even if they have completed their sentence.</p>
<h2 id="specific">Sex Crime Specific Penalties</h2>
<p>Sex crimes in general carry harsh penalties and burdensome sanctions. Additionally, the more severe the sex crime, the greater prison time a person faces. Below are approximate prison sentences a first-time offender would be facing for specific sex crimes.</p>
<h3>Lewd or Lascivious Battery</h3>
<p>A person convicted of Lewd or Lascivious Battery would be facing a maximum sentence of fifteen (15) years in prison and a minimum sentence of seven (7) years in prison.</p>
<h3>Lewd Offenses</h3>
<p>There are a variety of laws that apply to Lewd or Lascivious offenses, generally the maximum penalty can be up to fifteen (15) years in prison and, in rare circumstances, the minimum sentence can be sex offender probation.</p>
<p>The most commonly charged lewd offenses are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#lewd_or_lascivious_molestation">Lewd or Lascivious Molestation; Sexual Touching of a Child</a></li>
<li><a href="#lewd_or_lascivious_conduct">Lewd or Lascivious Conduct</a></li>
<li><a href="#lewd_or_lascivious_molestation">Lewd or Lascivious Exhibition</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Sexual Battery and Rape</h3>
<p><a href="#sexual_battery">Sexual Battery</a> carries the most severe penalties of all sexual crimes in Florida. Depending on the victim’s characteristics, a person convicted of sexual battery (rape) would be facing a maximum sentence of life in prison and a minimum sentence of nine (9) years in prison. </p>
<h3>Unlawful Sex with Minors and Statutory Rape</h3>
<p>A person convicted of <a href="#unlawful_sexual_activity_with_minors">Unlawful Sexual Activity with Minors</a>, commonly called Statutory Rape, is facing a maximum sentence of fifteen (15) years in prison and a minimum sentence of approximately five (5) years in prison.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Florida’s Romeo and Juliet Law</h1>
<blockquote class="half">The ultimate decision is up to the judge.</blockquote>
<p>In 2007, Florida enacted what is commonly referred to as the “Romeo and Juliet” law.</p>
<p itemprop="description">The purpose of this law was to allow certain young individuals (so-called “Romeo and Juliet” offenders) convicted of statutory sex crimes, the ability to avoid the harsh consequence of lifetime inclusion on the sex-offender registry because of a consensual sexual conduct. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, this law did not create a “near-age” defense to crimes that involve unlawful sexual activity with minors.</p>
<p>Rather, the law allows certain people convicted of crimes involving unlawful sexual activity with minors to avoid designation as a sexual offender or sexual predator and being required to submit to lifetime sexual offender registration requirements.</p>
<h2 id="eligibility-requirements">Eligibility Under the Romeo and Juliet Law</h2>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/943.04354">Florida Statute 943.04354</a>, a person’s case must meet the following requirements to be eligible to petition for removal from the sex offender registration laws:</p>
<ul>
<li>The conviction was for:

<li>A <a href="#lewd_or_lascivious">Lewd or Lascivious Offense</a> (F.S. 800.04);</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The crime involved a consensual sexual encounter with a 14, 15, 16, or 17 year old minor;</li>
<li>The minor was no more than 4 years younger than the defendant at the time of the sexual encounter;</li>
<li>Registration as a sexual offender (or predator) is solely because of the above conviction;</li>
<li>No other convictions for a Lewd or Lascivious Offense, Sexual Battery, or Lewd or Lascivious Exhibition using a Computer exist.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Four Year Window Calculation</h3>
<p>Florida strictly interprets the four-year window requirement. As a result, to be eligible under the Romeo &amp; Juliet law, a defendant’s birthday must be within four literal years (1,460 days) of the minor’s birthday. If a defendant is one day past the four-year eligibility limit, the defendant is ineligible to petition for relief. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h3>Pre-2007 Cases</h3>
<p>Individuals who otherwise meet the Romeo &amp; Juliet eligibility criteria, but who were convicted prior to its 2007 enactment, may also petition the court for removal from the sex offender registry in the county where they were originally convicted.</p>
<h3>Discretionary Relief</h3>
<p>Importantly though, even if a person qualifies for removal of the sex offender designation, the ultimate decision is a discretionary decision left up to the reviewing trial judge.</p>

<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Sexual Battery</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, the two primary defenses to the crime of Sexual Battery or rape are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#consent">Consent</a></li>
<li><a href="#false-allegations">False Allegations</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="consent">Consent</h3>
<p>Consent is a defense to an accusation of sexual battery or rape, but only if the consent was found to be intelligently, knowing, and voluntarily made. This means that if a person says they were unknowingly drugged or too intoxicated to consent, a jury could find that they did not consent to the sexual activity voluntarily.</p>
<p>Likewise, the failure of the accuser to offer physical resistance will not be deemed consent. Rather it will be something a jury can consider when determining whether the sexual interaction was consensual or coerced submission.</p>
<h4>Coerced Submission</h4>
<p>On the other hand, sexual battery or rape will be deemed coerced submission if force, threats, or intimidation were used to compel the sexual interaction.</p>
<p>This is an important distinction, because if an accuser alleges they feared for their life, physical safety, or the life and safety of a loved one, they can assert that they had no other alternative than to submit to a sexual act - thus they did not consent under the law.</p>
<h3 id="false-allegations">False Allegations</h3>
<p>False allegations of sexual battery or rape are increasingly common in Florida and one of the primary reasons people find themselves accused of sexual battery or rape.</p>
<p>Typical reasons for false allegations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of being caught in an affair</li>
<li>Jealousy</li>
<li>Manipulation of children by an angry parent</li>
<li>Mental illness of the accuser</li>
<li>Mentally ill parents influencing a child</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it is vitally important that an accuser’s motives are thoroughly investigated so that any motive for making a false accusation of sexual battery or rape can be exposed to a jury.</p>

<p>Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/794.05">Florida Statute 794.05</a>, the crime of Unlawful Sexual Activity with Minors is committed when a person twenty-four (24) years of age or older engages in consensual sexual activity with a person 16 or 17 years of age.</p>
<h3>Ignorance of Victim’s Age</h3>
<p>Importantly, even if the victim lied about his or her age or the accused had a bona fide belief the victim was 18 or older, ignorance of the victim’s age is precluded by statute as a defense to the crime of Unlawful Sexual Activity with Minors.</p>
<h3>Non-Consensual Sex with Minors</h3>
<p>While it is legal under certain situations for an adult (18-23) to have consensual sex with a minor (16-17) it is nonetheless <a href="#sexual_battery">Sexual Battery (Rape)</a> if the minor alleges the sex was non-consensual or forced.</p>

<h3 id="civil-consequences">Civil Consequences</h3>
<p>A person convicted of Unlawful Sexual Activity with Minors would not only be placed on <a href="#criminal_probation_sex_offender_probation">sex offender probation</a>, but would also be declared a sexual offender.</p>

<p>The only exception to the mandatory sex offender designation is if the person falls under Florida’s “<a href="#romeo_juliet_law">Romeo and Juliet</a>” law.</p>
<p>This law allows certain individuals to petition the court to be excluded from the sex offender registry. However, you can only petition for exclusion if the facts of your crime meet very specific <a href="romeo-juliet-law.html#eligibility-requirements">eligibility requirements</a>.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Theft Charges in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">The crime of Theft involves the taking of another person’s property.</blockquote>
<p>Florida divides the crime of Theft into two categories and then further separates them by degree:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#petit_theft">Petit Theft</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="petit-theft.html#first-degree">Petit Theft of the First Degree</a></li>
<li><a href="petit-theft.html#second-degree">Petit Theft of the Second Degree</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#grand_theft">Grand Theft</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="grand-theft.html#first-degree">Grand Theft of the First Degree</a></li>
<li><a href="grand-theft.html#second-degree">Grand Theft of the Second Degree</a></li>
<li><a href="grand-theft.html#third-degree">Grand Theft of the Third Degree</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="definition">Definition of Theft</h2>
<p>The crime of <dfn>Theft</dfn> involves the taking of another person’s property with the intent to either temporarily or permanently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deprive the person of a right to the property or benefit the property provides; or</li>
<li>Appropriates the property for personal use or for the use of another person not entitled to the use of the property.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Theft</h2>
<p>The penalties for the crime of theft depend on either the value of the property taken or on the type of property taken.</p>
<p>Generally though, Grand Theft involves the taking of property valued at more than $300 and is punishable as a felony; additionally, the degree of the felony increases as the value of the property taken increases.</p>
<p>Petit Theft involves the taking of property valued less than $300 and is punishable as a misdemeanor.</p>
<h2 id="statute-of-limitations">Statute of Limitations for Theft</h2>
<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/812.035">Florida Statute 812.035(10)</a>, a five year Statute of Limitations applies to the crimes of <a href="#petit_theft">Petit Theft</a>, <a href="#grand_theft">Grand Theft</a>, and <a href="#dealing_in_stolen_property">Dealing in Stolen Property</a>. This specific statute of limitations controls over the general statute of limitations otherwise applicable to all criminal cases under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/775.15">section 775.15</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, a prosecution for even the most minor theft offense, such as <a href="#petit_theft">Petit Theft</a>, can be brought up to five years after being committed (and even longer in some cases). <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Theft</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Theft are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#equal-ownership">Equal Ownership</a></li>
<li><a href="#Good-Faith-Possession">Good Faith Possession</a></li>
<li><a href="#valueless-property">Valueless Property</a></li>
<li><a href="#voluntary-abandonment">Voluntary Abandonment</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="equal-ownership">Equal Ownership</h3>
<p>A co-owner of property cannot be convicted of Theft for taking the property unless the complaining co-owner had a superior legal interest in the property. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="Good-Faith-Possession">Good Faith Possession</h3>
<p>Under Florida law, the crime of Petit Theft requires proof of a taking with the intent to steal. A person who takes possession of an item with the good faith belief in the right to the property lacks the requisite intent to commit theft. As a result, a well-founded belief in one’s right to allegedly stolen property constitutes a complete defense to the crime of Theft. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="mere-presence">Mere Presence</h3>
<p>Under Florida law, mere presence at the scene of a crime, mere knowledge that an offense is being committed, or even a display of questionable behavior after the commission of a crime is insufficient, standing alone, to establish participation in the crime. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<p>As a result, if you are out with a friend who commits a theft, you cannot be convicted as an accomplice unless it can be shown you did something in furtherance of the crime of Theft.</p>
<h3 id="valueless-property">Valueless Property</h3>
<p>Simply put, it is impossible to steal trash because Florida law only criminalizes the stealing of “property.”</p>
<p>Property is defined as “anything of value” and the value is the “the market value of property at the time and place of the offense or, if such cannot be satisfactorily ascertained, the cost of replacement of the property within a reasonable time after the offense.” <small><a href="#references">[5]</a></small></p>
<p>Thus if someone places something by the road, it has become trash that presumably has no value.</p>
<h3 id="voluntary-abandonment">Voluntary Abandonment</h3>
<p>It is a defense to the crime of Theft that a defendant abandoned the attempt to commit the theft under circumstances indicating a complete and voluntary renunciation of the criminal purpose. <small><a href="#references">[6]</a></small></p>
<h4>Involuntary Abandonment</h4>
<p>While voluntary abandonment is a defense to the crime of Theft, involuntary abandonment is not a defense. The distinguishing characteristic between the two is the reason for abandoning the theft. <small><a href="#references">[7]</a></small></p>
<p>A voluntary abandonment occurs when your conscious, unprompted by encountered circumstances, causes you to withdraw from the attempted theft.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an involuntary abandonment occurs when unanticipated circumstances (i.e. belief scheme discovered) causes a person to withdraw from the attempted theft.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Carjacking in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">The crime of Carjacking is a First Degree Felony punishable by up to thirty years in prison.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/812.133">Florida Statute 812.133</a>, the crime of Carjacking is committed when a person intentionally and unlawfully takes another person’s motor vehicle through the use of force, violence, assault, or threat.</p>
<p>Additionally, the applicable penalties increase when a weapon or firearm is used during the commission of the Carjacking.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Carjacking</h2>
<p>The crime of Carjacking is a First Degree Felony and is assigned a Level 7 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.</p>
<p>If convicted of carjacking, a judge is required to impose a minimum prison sentence of 21 months in prison absent grounds to impose a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence and can also impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to thirty (30) years in prison.</li>
<li>Up to thirty (30) years of probation.</li>
<li>Up to $10,000 in fines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weapon Enhancement</h3>
<p>If a weapon is used in the commission of the Carjacking, the crime becomes punishable by up to life in prison and will be classified as a Level 9 offense under Florida’s sentencing guidelines, which would require a judge to impose a minimum prison sentence of 48 months in prison.</p>
<h3>10/20/Life Firearm Enhancement</h3>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/775.087">Florida Statute 775.087(2)(a)(1)</a>, a person convicted of actually possessing a firearm during the commission of a Carjacking, as opposed to being an unarmed accomplice, is subject to being sentenced under Florida’s 10/20/Life statute.</p>
<p>Under the 10/20/Life statute, and depending on how the firearm was used, a person convicted of Carjacking would receive one of the following minimum-mandatory prison sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimum 10 year prison term if in possession of a firearm;</li>
<li>A minimum 20 year prison term if the firearm was discharged; and</li>
<li>A minimum 25 year prison term if someone is injured or killed by the firearm.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Carjacking</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Carjacking include:</p>
<h3 id="afterthought-defense">Afterthought Defense</h3>
<p>It is a defense to the crime of Carjacking if the taking of a motor vehicle occurred as an afterthought to the use of force or violence. (However, the taking may still constitute Grand Theft Motor Vehicle.) <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>For example, if two people got into a fight, resulting in one of the two being knocked out, it would not be Robbery to take the unconscious person’s keys off of a table and take his car, because the taking of the watch was an afterthought that occurred after the fight had concluded. (Although it would constitute the lesser offense of Grand Theft Motor Vehicle.)</p>
<h3 id="claim-of-right">Claim of Right Defense</h3>
<p>Under Florida law, a forcible taking of a Motor Vehicle under a bona fide claim of right is not Carjacking where the taker has a good faith belief that he or she is the owner, or is entitled to immediate possession, of the Motor Vehicle. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="mere-presence">Mere Presence</h3>
<p>Under Florida law, mere presence at the scene of a crime, mere knowledge that an offense is being committed, or even a display of questionable behavior after the commission of a crime is insufficient, standing alone, to establish participation in the crime. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>As a result, if you are out with a friend who spontaneously steals an occupied vehicle, you cannot be convicted as an accomplice unless it can be shown you did something in furtherance of the crime of Carjacking.</p>

<h3 id="mere-presence">Mere Presence</h3>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Retail Theft in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">The crime of Retail Theft involves the unlawful taking of merchandise or property from a merchant, usually as part of an organized shoplifting ring.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/812.015">Florida Statute 812.015(1)(d)</a>, the crime of Retail Theft is committed when a person deprives a merchant of possession, use, benefit, or full retail value of merchandise by intentionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking possession of merchandise, property, money, or negotiable documents belonging to a merchant;</li>
<li>Altering or removing a label, universal product code, or price tag from merchandise;</li>
<li>Transferring merchandise from one container to another; or</li>
<li>Removing a shopping cart from the merchant's business.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Proving Value</h3>
<p>The value is determined by the sale price of the merchandise at the time it was stolen or otherwise removed, depriving the owner of their right to ownership and sale of the merchandise. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small> Consequently, it is irrelevant whether the “market value” of a stolen item may be significantly more or less than what the price tag reflects. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>Further, if a person commits multiple acts of retail theft, the value of each individual retail theft committed within a 30-day period is aggregated together to determine the total value of the property stolen from a merchant. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>However, if the prosecutor is unable to prove the total value of either an individual theft or multiple thefts within a 30-day period was more than $750, the charge(s) would constitute <a href="#petit_theft">petit theft</a>, which is more commonly referred to as shoplifting.</p>
<h3>Retail Theft vs. General Theft</h3>
<p>The Retail Theft statute allows a prosecutor to charge an individual or multiple people who are part of an organized shoplifting ring with a felony based on the aggregate retail value of merchandise stolen during a thirty (30) day period, even if the retail value of each individual theft was less than $750.</p>
<p>Generally, if the person is not part of an organized shoplifting ring or has not engaged in multiple thefts from the same merchant, they will be charged with under the general theft statute.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Retail Theft</h2>
<p>There are two degrees of Retail Theft that can be committed in Florida. The degree of the crime and the corresponding penalties increase based on the value of the property taken and the person's prior Retail Theft convictions.</p>
<p>The two degrees of Retail Theft in Florida are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#third-degree">Third Degree Felony Retail Theft</a></li>
<li><a href="#second-degree">Second Degree Felony Retail Theft</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="third-degree">Third Degree Felony Retail Theft</h3>
<p>Third Degree Felony Retail Theft is committed when the aggregate retail value of merchandise taken over a thirty (30) day period is worth more than $750.</p>
<p>Third Degree Felony Retail Theft is punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and $5,000 in fines.</p>
<p>Third Degree Felony Retail Theft is assigned a Level 5 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge may sentence a person convicted of Third Degree Felony Retail Theft to probation, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of five years in prison.</p>
<h3 id="second-degree">Second Degree Felony Retail Theft</h3>
<p>Second Degree Felony Retail Theft is committed if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aggregate retail value taken over a thirty (30) day period is worth more than $3,000; or</li>
<li>The defendant has previously been convicted of Retail Theft and commits a subsequent Retail Theft.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second Degree Felony Retail Theft is punishable by up to fifteen (15) years in prison, fifteen (15) years of probation, and $10,000 in fines.</p>
<p>Second Degree Felony Retail Theft is assigned a Level 5 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge may sentence a person convicted of Second Degree Felony Retail Theft to probation, but may also sentence the person up to the statutory maximum of fifteen years in prison.</p>

<p>A voluntary abandonment occurs when your conscious, unprompted by encountered circumstances, causes you to withdraw from the attempted Retail Theft.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an involuntary abandonment occurs when unanticipated circumstances (i.e. belief scheme discovered) causes a person to withdraw from the attempted Retail Theft.</p>

<p>If convicted of Theft of State Funds of $100,000 or more, a judge must impose a sentence of 21 months in prison absent grounds to impose a <a href="#criminal_sentencing_downward_departure">downward departure</a> sentence and can also impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>

<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Theft of State Funds include:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#good-faith-belief">Good Faith Belief</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="good-faith-belief">Good Faith Belief</h3>
<p>Under Florida law, the crime of Theft of State Funds requires proof that the merchant intented to deprive the state of the collected funds. So a merchant who keeps sales taxes with a good faith belief in the right to the funds based upon an accountant or lawyer’s advice would likely lack the requisite intent to commit Theft of State Funds.</p>
<p>As a result, a well-founded belief in one’s right to the funds would constitute a complete defense to the crime of Theft of State Funds. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Driving while License Suspended (DWLS) in Florida</h1>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/322.34">Florida Statute 322.34</a>, it is a civil infraction to unknowingly drive a vehicle while your driver license was canceled, suspended, or revoked and it is a criminal offense to knowingly drive a vehicle while your driver license was canceled, suspended, or revoked.</p>
<p>And Driving while License Suspended (DWLS) is one of the most common criminal charges in Florida’s court system, it is also a charge that lawyers frequently resolve incorrectly because they do not take the time to develop a proper defense.</p>
<p>Instead, many lawyers simply advise clients to plead to a “<a href="#criminal_sentencing_judgment">withhold</a> and small fine.” But what they don't explain is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DWLS is eligible for a <a href="#clerk-election">Clerk of Court Election</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="#criminal_sentencing_judgment">Withhold of Adjudication</a> counts as a conviction under Florida law. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></li>
<li>Three <acronym title="Driving While Driver License Suspended">DWLS</acronym> convictions within a five year period will result in a five-year driver license revocation as a <a href="#habitual_traffic_offender">Habitual Traffic Offender</a>.</li>
<li>A subsequent <acronym title="Driving While Driver License Suspended">DWLS</acronym> may result in a felony charge.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="elements">Elements of Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked</h2>
<p>To criminally prosecute someone for Knowingly Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked, the State must prove:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#suspended">The Driver's License was Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked.</a></li>
<li><a href="#knowledge">The Driver had Advance Knowledge of the Suspension, Cancellation, or Revocation.</a></li>
<li><a href="#florida-highway">The Vehicle was Driven on a Florida Highway.</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="suspended">The Driver License was Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked</h3>
<p>A certified copy of the driver's Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr> driving record is introduced to prove whether a person's driver license was suspended, canceled, or revoked on the date of the offense.</p>
<p>However the Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr> makes mistakes and very frequently shows a valid driver’s license as being suspended.</p>
<p>Consequently, an erroneous driving record that reflects an incorrect suspension, cancelation, or revocation can be fought or reduced to a civil infraction.</p>
<h3 id="knowledge">The Driver had Advance Knowledge of the Suspension.</h3>
<p>A driver's knowledge of a driver license suspension, cancellation, or revocation is the most litigated issue in a <acronym title="Driving While License Suspended">DWLS</acronym> case.</p>
<p>A driver's knowledge of a suspension, cancelation, or revocation can be proven by showing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The driver admits to knowledge of the suspension, cancellation, or revocation.</li>
<li>The driver has previously been cited for <acronym title="Driving While License Suspended">DWLS</acronym> (without an intervening license reinstatement).</li>
<li>The driver received a court order, judgment, or administrative order containing a notice that the person’s driver license was being suspended, canceled, or revoked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Absent proof the driver personally received notice of a suspension, cancellation, or revocation through a court judgment or administrative order, the State is required to prove that knowledge of the suspension, cancellation, or revocation was provided to the driver by substitute means as authorized by statute. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h3 id="florida-highway">The Vehicle was Driven on a Florida Highway.</h3>
<p>The prosecutor must prove the vehicle was driven on a Florida Highway. And while uncommon, there are certain roadways and areas that are not consider part of Florida’s highways. Consequently, under unique circumstance, such as being arrested in a construction zone, a gated community, or on private land, it is possible have a <acronym title="Driving While License Suspended">DWLS</acronym> case dismissed if the driving was conducted solely within one of these unique areas.</p>
<h2 id="clerk-election">Clerk of Court Election</h2>
<p>There is a little known election available through the Clerk of Court that allows a person charged with civil or criminal <acronym title="Driving While License Suspended">DWLS</acronym> to resolve their case without appearing before a judge or being convicted.</p>
<p>If you qualify for the Clerk of Court election, a valid, renewed, or reinstated driver license, must be presented to the Clerk of Court who is then authorized to dispose of the case outside of the normal channel of prosecution by accepting a written plea of nolo contendere and imposing minimal court costs. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>Importantly, a <acronym title="Driving While License Suspended">DWLS</acronym> resolved with the Clerk of Court election does not count as a conviction for enhancement purposes and cannot be used by the Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr> as a predicate offense towards a five-year Habitual Traffic Offender driver license revocation. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked</h2>
<p>The Penalties for Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked are determined by the number of times a person has previously been convicted of <acronym title="Driving While License Suspended">DWLS</acronym> and the reason for the current suspension, cancellation, or revocation.</p>
<h3 id="first-offense">First Offense Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked</h3>
<p>A first offense of Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked is a Second Degree Misdemeanor in Florida and punishable by up to sixty (60) days in jail, six (6) months of probation, and a $500 fine.</p>
<h3 id="second-offense">Second or Subsequent Offense Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked</h3>
<p>A second or subsequent offense of Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked is a First Degree Misdemeanor in Florida and punishable by up to one (1) year in jail, one (1) year of probation, and a $1,000 fine.</p>
<h3 id="third-offense">Third Offense Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked</h3>
<p>A third offense of Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked can be prosecuted as a felony if the underlying driver license suspension, cancellation, or revocation is a result of a <a href="dui/">DUI</a>, refusal to submit to a DUI alcohol test, a traffic offense causing death or serious bodily injury, or <a href="#fleeing_and_eluding">fleeing or eluding</a>.</p>
<p>Felony Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked is a Third Degree Felony in Florida and is punishable by up to five (5) years in prison, five (5) years of probation, and $5,000 in fines.</p>
<p>Felony Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked is assigned a Level 1 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>. A judge must sentence a person convicted of Felony Driving While License Suspended, Canceled, or Revoked to probation, to a minimum of ten (10) days in jail but may also impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum of five (5) years in prison.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Fighting a <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> in Florida</h1>
<p itemprop="description">Before a trial is ever held, a <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> can be challenged on constitutional, legal, or administrative grounds. A successful challenge can result in key state’s evidence being thrown out by the court, making it impossible for the State to continue prosecution.</p>
<p>The primary ways to attack a <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#stop">Challenge the Stop</a></li>
<li><a href="#field-sobriety-tests">Challenge the Field Sobriety Tests</a></li>
<li><a href="#breathalyzer">Challenge the Breathalyzer Results</a></li>
<li><a href="#statements">Suppress Your Statements</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Law enforcement is notorious for stopping a vehicle on a “hunch” that the you have been drinking. Once stopped, their investigative methods are crude and inaccurate; and many officers making <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> arrests have limited training on the effects of alcohol in the body.</p>
<p>In turn, the machines relied upon by LEOs to test your breath, blood, or urine for alcohol are subject to error. Additionally, even though these machines must meet strict governmental regulations to be admissible, but they are often improperly maintained.</p>
<p>So what does all of this mean? Simply put, the State needs all of their evidence to prevent a judge from dismissing the case for lack of evidence or to present a strong case to a jury.</p>
<p>If I challenge one link in the State’s case, which results in evidence being thrown out (suppressed), the State may be prohibited from proceeding or forced to negotiate a deal to a lesser charge. In <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> defense, winning one battle can result in winning the war!</p>
<h2 id="stop">Challenge the Stop</h2>
<p>The law is very clear that a law enforcement officer may only stop you for one of two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the officer has a reasonable suspicion that your are committing a traffic infraction, or </li>
<li>If the officer has probable cause that you are committing a crime.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, many times it can be shown that the officer was mistaken in his reason for stopping you. If this is proven, all of the evidence in your case will be thrown out and the State will be forced to dismiss your case.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Say an officer stopped you for an expired license plate and subsequently arrested you for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>.</p>
<p>If I can prove that your license plate was not expired and the officer was mistaken, the Judge will find that the officer made an illegal stop and throw out the evidence against you. This will force the State to dismiss the case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="field-sobriety-tests">Challenge the Field Sobriety Tests</h2>
<p>In most <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> cases, law enforcement will administer Field Sobriety Tests prior to arresting you. There are several ways to challenge the officer’s testimony about your performance on these tests:</p>
<blockquote class="half">Does the officer know what your true balance and coordination is?</blockquote>
<p>Do you have any physical disabilities like a bad back or bad knees? Physical disabilities or injuries may affect your ability to perform the test, thereby making them unreliable and inadmissible.</p>
<p>Is the officer qualified to perform the specific Field Sobriety Test? Some Field Sobriety tests, such as the HGN test (eyes following pen test), may only be performed and testified about by certified alcohol recognition experts. Other tests, such as the  reverse alphabet test are not deemed reliable by the courts.</p>
<h2 id="breathalyzer">Challenge the Breathalyzer</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, the machines used by law enforcement are tightly regulated and subject to strict maintenance requirements to be admissible. Additionally, the testing must be done in a very specific manner.</p>
<p>The failure to either properly maintain the machines or conduct the tests in accordance with required procedures can result in the results being ruled inadmissible, no matter how high your results were.</p>
<h3>Example Issues</h3>
<p>The failure of an officer to do any of these simple steps, or possibly other steps not mentioned, may result in the breath test results being thrown out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the officer observe you for 20 minutes straight prior to the breath test?</li>
<li>Did the officer tell you to “keep blowing” during the breath test?</li>
<li>Did the officer calibrate the machine properly prior to testing?</li>
<li>Did the officer read Florida’s Implied Consent Law or incorrectly state the law?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="statements">Suppress Your Statements</h2>
<p>One of the most well known Miranda Warnings states: “Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.” However, contrary to popular belief, an officer does not have to immediately read you your rights when stopping you for a traffic infraction. </p>
<p>Upon initially being stopped, an officer is free to ask you common questions such as where are you coming from, where are you going, have you had anything to drink. Therefore it is important you watch what you say, especially if you have been drinking.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you do say something incriminating to law enforcement, I may still be able to suppress your incriminating statements.</p>
<p>Generally, statements are challenged for being obtained in violation of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#right-to-remain-silent">Your Right to Remain Silent</a>, or</li>
<li><a href="#accident-report-privilege">Florida’s Accident Report Privilege</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="right-to-remain-silent">Your Right to Remain Silent</h3>
<p>An officer only has to read you your rights when you are under arrest, or if you are no longer free to leave. Once an officer reads you your rights you should politely decline to speak with him any further and request an attorney.</p>
<p>A common problem that arises in <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> arrests is when it is clear that you are no longer free to leave, the officer never reads you your rights, and continues to question you about your activities prior to being stopped. This practice is illegal and any incriminating statements gained by an officer during this time can be thrown out by a judge.</p>
<h3 id="accident-report-privilege">Florida’s Accident Report Privilege</h3>
<p>Many times, if you are in an accident you will later find yourself accused of <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>. In Florida, you are required by law to report the accident to authorities, raising the possibility that you may make incriminating statements to law enforcement regarding the accident. </p>
<p>Fortunately, Florida law excludes most statements you give to law enforcement about an accident from being used in a later civil or criminal trial. This is known as Florida’s Accident Report Privilege and the purpose of the privilege is to encourage witnesses to cooperate with law enforcement in automobile accident investigations.</p>
<p>However, the Accident Report Privilege is not absolute and there is one major exception. If a law enforcement officer suspects that you were driving under the influence, or committed another crime related to the crash, he may “switch hats” and inform you that he is no longer conducting a crash or accident investigation; rather he is now beginning a criminal investigation related to the accident. </p>
<p>To continue questioning you, the officer must then read you your rights if he wishes to continue. At this point you should decline to answer anymore questions and request a lawyer. </p>
<p>Many times the officer fails to “switch hats” and read your rights. If an officer fails to properly “switch hats” or read your rights, any statements you make to the officer may be suppressed under Florida’s Accident Report Privilege. </p>
<h3>Be Careful with Spontaneous Statements</h3>
<p>The biggest exception to your right to remain silent and the Accident Report Privilege occurs when you make a spontaneous statements. A spontaneous statement is one that is volunteered without being asked a question. Any spontaneous statements you make before or after being read your rights can be used against you, regardless if other statements are thrown out due to illegal police misconduct or the accident report privilege.</p>

</ul>
<hr/>
<p id="1"><b>What is <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> and Drunk Driving?</b><br/>
				Answer: DUI is an abbreviation for “driving under the influence.” A person is guilty of the offense if such person is driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle within the state and the person is under the influence of alcoholic beverages or any chemical or controlled substance set forth under the applicable statutes when affected to the extent that his or her normal faculties are impaired or when the person has a blood alcohol level of 0.08% or higher. “Drunk Driving” is a common misnomer for the crime of driving under the influence. While all individuals who drive while drunk are <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>, you do not need to be drunk to be considered under the influence. </p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p id="2"><b>Can the Police take away my license if I am arrested for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>?</b><br/>
				Answer: Under Florida law, a law enforcement officer may seize the driver’s license of any person who is driving with an unlawful blood alcohol level of 0.08% or above, or who has refused to submit to a breath, blood or urine test. The officer will seize the individual’s driver’s license and issue the driver a traffic ticket which acts as both a ten (10) day temporary work permit (although, in most cases, the citation will incorrectly state that it is only valid for seven (7) days because the police departments have not printed new citation books to reflect the recent changes to the law) and as a notice of the suspension.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p id="3"><b>If the Officer takes away my license, for how long is it suspended?</b><br/>
				Answer: If you have refused to submit to a lawful breath, blood or urine test, your driving privilege will be suspended for a period of one (1) year for a first refusal, or for a period of eighteen (18) months if your driving privilege has previously been suspended as a result of a refusal to submit to such a test. If you have an unlawful blood alcohol level (that is, 0.08% or above), your driving privilege will be suspended for a period of six (6) months for a first offense, or for a period of one (1) year if your driving privilege has been previously suspended. All such  suspensions are effective as of the date of the arrest.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p id="4"><b>Why can my license be suspended before a trial; can I challenge the suspension?</b><br/>
				Answer: While the criminal punishment under Florida laws provides for certain safeguards before an individual may be sentenced, you must remember that driving a motor vehicle is a privilege, not a right. Because it is a privilege, the State of Florida may withdraw that privilege if it has lawful grounds to do so. However, you have ten (10) days from the date your license was seized or suspended to request a formal review hearing before the Bureau of Administrative Review with the Florida DHSMV where you can challenge the legality of your license being suspended.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p id="5"><b>Is it unlawful to drive with a blood alcohol level of 0.08% or higher?</b><br/>
				Answer: Yes. It is a crime to drive with an unlawful blood alcohol level of 0.08% or above.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p id="6"><b>Are you presumed guilty if you have a blood alcohol level of 0.08% or higher?</b><br/>
				Answer: In any criminal case, it is unconstitutional to hold a presumption of guilt against a defendant. This is due to the fact that our constitution requires the government to prove its case beyond and to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt. However, the fact that you had 0.08% or more by weight of alcohol in your blood is prima facie evidence that you were under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that your normal faculties were impaired.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p id="7"><b>May I refuse to take a Breath, Blood, or Urine test if requested?</b><br/>
				Answer: By accepting the privilege extended by the laws of this state of operating a motor vehicle, you are deemed to have given your consent to submit to an approved chemical or physical test of your breath for the purposes of determining the alcoholic content of your blood, and to a urine test for the purposes of detecting the presence of drugs, if lawfully arrested for any offense allegedly committed while driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages, chemical substances, or controlled substances. However, you may refuse to take such tests unless you are involved in an accident involving serious bodily injury or death to a human being. However, refusing such tests is not without cost. The law permits the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to suspend your privilege to operate a motor vehicle for a period of one (1) year for a first refusal, or a period of eighteen (18) months for a second or subsequent refusal. Additionally, the refusal to submit to a chemical or physical breath test, or to a urine test, upon the request of a law enforcement officer, is admissible in any criminal proceeding against you. Also, if you have previously refused to submit to a breath, blood or urine test, a second or subsequent refusal to submit to such testing is a misdemeanor offense.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p id="8"><b>What does “In Actual Physical Control” mean? </b><br/>
				Answer: This term means that the individual has had the capability and power to dominate, direct or regulate the vehicle, regardless of whether or not he or she was exercising that capability or power at the time of the alleged offense. In other words, sitting behind the wheel with the keys in the ignition may qualify as being “in actual physical control” of a vehicle even though the vehicle is not moving.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p id="9"><b>What are the minimum penalties for a first time <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>?</b><br/>
				
				Answer: You will be Adjudicated Guilty, meaning you will have a permanent criminal record. You will be placed on one year of supervised probation, fined $250, ordered to complete 50 hour of community service, vehicle impoundment of ten (10) days, required to attend and successfully complete an approved <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Counter Attack School, be evaluated for any substance abuse problems, and undergo any recommended treatment.

<p id="10"><b>I blew over the legal limit, can I possibly beat the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>?</b><br/>
				Answer: Absolutely! The machines used by law enforcement are tightly regulated and subject to strict maintenance requirements to be deemed reliable. Additionally, the testing itself must be done in a very specific manner. The failure to either properly maintain the machines, or to conduct the tests in accordance with the standard testing procedures, can result in the breath test being thrown out altogether, no matter how high your test came back. </p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Florida <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Driver License Suspensions</h1>
<p itemprop="description">As a result of your <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> arrest, your Driver License is subject to two separate suspensions and it is important that you know the difference between each type of suspension.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first is known as a <a href="#administrative-suspension"><abbr title="Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr>  Administrative Suspension</a>.</li>
<li>The second is known as a <a href="#criminal-suspension">Criminal Suspension</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most importantly, it is imperative that you are aware of <a href="#ten-day-rule">Florida’s Ten Day Rule</a> regarding your right to fight the <abbr title="The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr>  Administrative Suspension.</p>
<h2 id="administrative-suspension">Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr> Administrative Suspension</h2>
<p>The first Driver License suspension you are subject to is imposed by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles and is known as an Administrative Suspension. This suspension is imposed if, after your <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> arrest, you either</p>
<ul>
<li>Refused to submit to a breath, urine or blood test, or</li>
<li>Submitted to a breath, urine or blood test and your blood alcohol level was found to be .08 or higher.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you refused to submit to a BAC/BAL test, or if your BAC/BAL was over .08 your Driver License will be suspended for either 6 months, 1 year, or 18 months from the date of your arrest. If your license is suspended for either reason, you will be issued a temporary driving permit that expires at midnight on the 10th day following the date of your arrest.</p>
<h3 id="Ten-Day-Rule">Florida’s Ten Day Rule</h3>
<p>We only have 10 days from the date of your arrest to request a Formal Review Hearing with the <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr> to contest your Administrative Driver License Suspension.</p>
<p>If you do not hire me within the ten-day period, I will be unable to request a Formal Review Hearing. If this happens, your license will be suspended for up to 18 months depending on the facts of your <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> case. So it is critical that you contact me within this 10-day period.</p>
<p>If we timely request a Formal Review Hearing, I will be able to obtain a Temporary Driving Permit from the <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr> that will allow you to drive under a business purposes only restriction for the next 42 days. During that 42 day period, I will schedule your Formal Review Hearing to challenge the <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr>’s administrative suspension of your driver’s license. </p>
<p>If I prevail in your Formal Review Hearing, you will be eligible to resume normal driving pending the resolution of your criminal case. </p>
<p>However, if I am unsuccessful and the suspension is upheld, your driver’s license will remains suspended for at least another six months (possibly more if your DUI has aggravated facts). If this is the case, you will need to understand and abide by the rules for <a href="#Hardship">obtaining a hardship driver’s license</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Hardship">Obtaining a Hardship Driver License</h3>
<p>If I am unable to successfully challenge the administrative suspension, you may still be eligible for a hardship license if you meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have never been criminally convicted of more than two DUI offenses.</li>
<li>Have completed (or be enrolled in) the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Counter Attack School, and </li>
<li>Have served out the “Hard Suspension” period of your administrative suspension. The period is as follows:
									<ul>
<li>30 days for a <abbr title="Blood or Breath Alcohol Content">BAC</abbr> over .08, or</li>
<li>90 days for a refusal to submit to a Blood or Breath Alcohol Content test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you meet these requirements you can request a Hardship Review Hearing after the hard suspension has expired. If you are given approval to drive for hardship purposes, you must then present the approval form to your local <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr> and obtain a restricted driver’s license. </p>
<p>Finally, you must complete the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> school within 90 days of receiving the hardship license. Failure to complete the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> school or any required substance abuse treatment will result in cancellation of your hardship license until the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> school and treatment is completed.</p>
<p>At the time of your license reinstatement you must take the required examination, pay a administrative fee, a reinstatement fee, and any license fee required. Additionally, you must show proof of liability insurance on the arrest date and proof of current liability coverage.</p>
<h2 id="criminal-suspension">Criminal Suspension</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, there are two suspensions involved with a <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> charge, the Administrative Suspension imposed by the Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr>  and the Criminal Suspension imposed by the Court. Unfortunately, if you are criminally convicted of <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>, a secondary and mandatory suspension begins on the date of your conviction. And, if you obtained a hardship driver’s license, the judge will seize that license.</p>
<h3>Criminal Suspension Periods</h3>
<p>Depending on the degree of the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> you are facing, the following criminal suspension periods would be imposed if you were convicted. After that are the eligibility requirements for a hardship license if your were to experience a Criminal Suspension.</p>
<ol>
<li><font color="#660000">First Conviction:</font> Minimum 180 days revocation, maximum 1 year.</li>
<li><font color="#660000">Second Conviction Within 5 Years:</font> Minimum 5 years revocation. May be eligible for hardship reinstatement after 1 year. Other 2nd offenders same as above.</li>
<li><font color="#660000">Third Conviction outside of 10 Years:</font> If the two previous <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> convictions occurred more than 10 years prior to the current conviction, then you are only looking at a maximum of 1 year suspension. If one of the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> convictions occurred within 5 years of the current <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> conviction, then you are looking at a 5 year suspension</li>
<li><font color="#660000">Third Conviction Within 10 Years:</font> Minimum 10 years revocation. May be eligible for hardship reinstatement after 2 years.</li>
<li><font color="#660000">Fourth Conviction, Regardless of When Prior Convictions Occurred) and Murder with Motor Vehicle:</font> Mandatory permanent revocation. No hardship reinstatement.</li>
<li><font color="#660000"><abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Manslaughter:</font> Mandatory permanent revocation. If no prior <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> related convictions, may be eligible for hardship reinstatement after 5 years. </li>
<li><font color="#660000">Manslaughter, <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Serious Bodily Injury, or Vehicular Homicide Convictions:</font> Minimum 3 year revocation. <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Serious Bodily Injury having prior <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> conviction is same as “B-D” above.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Eligibility for Hardship License</h2>
<p>Depending on the degree of <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> you were convicted of, the following requirements must be met in order to be eligible for a hardship license following a criminal suspension.</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#660000">First Conviction:</font> You must complete the DUI school and apply to DHSMV for a hearing to obtain a hardship license. If your BAC was .15 or higher, you would be required to install an Ignition Interlock device for the first six months of your hardship license period.</li>
<li><font color="#660000">Second Convictions (or more):</font> You may apply for a hardship reinstatement hearing after one year. Before applying, you must complete the DUI school and remain in the DUI supervision program for the remainder of the revocation period. You would be required to install an Ignition Interlock device on your vehicle for one year.</li>
<li><font color="#660000">Second Conviction Within 5 Years: </font> (5 Year Revocation) You may apply for a hardship reinstatement hearing after one year. Before applying, you must complete the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> school and remain in the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> supervision program for the remainder of your revocation period (If you miss, or fail to attend counseling or treatment your hardship license will be canceled). Prior to applying you cannot have consumed any alcoholic beverage or controlled substance or driven a motor vehicle for 12 months prior to your hardship reinstatement. </li>
<li><font color="#660000">Third Conviction Within 10 Years:</font> (10 Year Revocation) You may request a hardship reinstatement hearing after the first two years of your revocation. To apply, you must have completed the DUI school and remain in the DUI supervision program for the remainder of your ten-year revocation period. If given a hardship license, you would be required to install a ignition interlock device for the first two years.</li>
<li><font color="#660000"><abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Manslaughter With No Prior <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Related Conviction:</font> (Permanent Revocation): You may be eligible for hardship reinstatement after 5 years from date of your revocation or from the date your release from prison, provided the following requirements are met: 
								<ol>
<li>You have not been arrested for a drug-related offense for at least 5 years prior to the hearing; </li>
<li>You have not driven a motor vehicle without a license for at least 5 years prior to the hearing; </li>
<li>You have been alcohol and drug-free for at least 5 years prior to the hearing; and </li>
<li>You complete the DUI school and are supervised under the DUI program for the remainder of the revocation period (Your failure to report for counseling or treatment will result in the cancellation of your hardship license).</li>
</ol>
<li><font color="#660000">Manslaughter, <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Serious Bodily Injury, or Vehicular Homicide Convictions </font> (3 Year Revocation): You may immediately apply for a hardship reinstatement hearing; however, you must complete the DUI school or advanced driver improvement course.</li>

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/316.193">Florida Statute 316.193(1) and (2)(a)</a>, the crime of first <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> offense is committed in Florida when a person:</p>

<ul>
<li>Up to six months in jail.</li>
<li>Up to twelve months of reporting probation.</li>

<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to First DUI Offense</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common evidentiary defenses that are raised in a First <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Offense are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#illegal-traffic-stop">Illegal Traffic Stop</a></li>
<li><a href="#improper-field-sobriety-tests">Improper Field Sobriety Tests</a></li>
<li><a href="#insufficient-probable-cause">Insufficient Probable Cause</a></li>
<li><a href="#inadmissible-breath-results">Inadmissible Breath Results</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="illegal-traffic-stop">Illegal Traffic Stop</h3>
<p>The law is very clear that a law enforcement officer may only stop a vehicle for one of two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the driver is committing a traffic infraction; or </li>
<li>If the officer has probable cause that the driver committed a crime.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, many times it can be shown that the officer was mistaken in his reason for conducting a traffic stop. If this is proven, all of the evidence obtained as a result of the illegal stop is suppressed and the prosecutor is forced to dismiss the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> case.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Example of Illegal Traffic Stop</h4>
<p>An officer stops a vehicle for an expired license plate and subsequently arrested the driver for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>.</p>
<p>If it can be shown that the officer was mistaken in his conclusion that the license plate was expired, the judge will find that the officer made an illegal stop and suppress any evidence obtained as a result of the traffic stop. This will force the prosecutor to dismiss the DUI case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="improper-field-sobriety-tests">Improper Field Sobriety Tests</h3>
<p>In most <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> cases, law enforcement will administer Field Sobriety Tests prior to arresting the driver. The purpose of these tests is supposedly to assist the officer in determining whether a person is impaired.</p>
		And while everyone knows that the tests are designed to make a person fail, there are several avenues to challenging the officer’s testimony about these tests:
		<ol>
<li>Is the officer familiar with the driver’s true balance and coordination?</li>
<li>Does the driver have any physical disabilities or injuries, such as a bad back or bad knees, which affect the driver’s ability to perform the tests, thereby making them unreliable and inadmissible.</li>
<li>Is the officer qualified to perform the specific Field Sobriety Test? Some Field Sobriety tests, such as the HGN test (eye following pen test), may only be relied upon when conducted by certified alcohol recognition experts. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></li>
<li>Were all of the tests deemed reliable by the courts. Some tests, such as the  reverse alphabet test, are not admissible in court.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="insufficient-probable-cause">Insufficient Probable Cause</h3>
<p>In order to arrest a driver for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>, an officer must have probable cause to believe that a driver was under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances to the extent that the driver’s normal faculties were impaired.</p>
<p>If it can be shown that the officer’s probable cause conclusion was based on insufficient evidence or an unreasonable conclusion, then the driver’s arrest will be deemed illegal and any subsequent evidence will be suppressed, resulting in the prosecutor dismissing the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Example of Insufficient Probable Cause</h4>
<p>Sometimes an officer’s sole reason to arrest a driver for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> is based on the odor of alcohol.</p>
<p>However, the odor of alcohol by itself has been ruled an insufficient reason for an officer to believe that a driver is “under the influence” of alcoholic beverages to justify an arrest for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h4>Example of Unreasonable Probable Cause</h4>
<p>If video of the Field Sobriety Tests objectively reveals that the driver performed satisfactorily in contradiction to the officer’s written report, many judges will find the officer’s conclusion that the person was impaired to be unreasonable.</p>
<p>As a result, the judge will suppress the arrest evidence and any subsequently obtained evidence, forcing the prosecutor to dismiss the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="inadmissible-breath-results">Inadmissible Breath Results</h3>
<p>The Breathalyzer machines used by law enforcement are tightly regulated and subject to strict maintenance requirements in order to be deemed admissible. Additionally, the testing must be done in a very specific, standardized manner.</p>
<p>The failure to either properly maintain the machines or to conduct the tests in accordance with required procedures can result in the breath alcohol results being ruled inadmissible, no matter how high the breath alcohol results were.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>The failure of an officer to perform any of these simple steps may result in the breath alcohol results being thrown out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the officer conduct a 20 minutes straight observation prior to administering the breath alcohol test?</li>
<li>Did the officer instruct the driver to “keep blowing” during the breath test?</li>
<li>Did the officer calibrate the machine properly prior to conducting the breath alcohol test?</li>
<li>Did the officer read Florida’s Implied Consent Law or incorrectly state the law?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="illegal-traffic-stop">Illegal Traffic Stop</h3>
<p>The law is very clear that a law enforcement officer may only stop a vehicle for one of two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the driver is committing a traffic infraction; or </li>
<li>If the officer has probable cause that the driver committed a crime.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, many times it can be shown that the officer was mistaken in his reason for conducting a traffic stop. If this is proven, all of the evidence obtained as a result of the illegal stop is suppressed and the prosecutor is forced to dismiss the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> case.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Example of Illegal Traffic Stop</h4>
<p>An officer stops a vehicle for an expired license plate and subsequently arrested the driver for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>.</p>
<p>If it can be shown that the officer was mistaken in his conclusion that the license plate was expired, the judge will find that the officer made an illegal stop and suppress any evidence obtained as a result of the traffic stop. This will force the prosecutor to dismiss the DUI case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="improper-field-sobriety-tests">Improper Field Sobriety Tests</h3>
<p>In most <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> cases, law enforcement will administer Field Sobriety Tests prior to arresting the driver. The purpose of these tests is supposedly to assist the officer in determining whether a person is impaired.</p>
		And while everyone knows that the tests are designed to make a person fail, there are several avenues to challenging the officer’s testimony about these tests:
		<ol>
<li>Is the officer familiar with the driver’s true balance and coordination?</li>
<li>Does the driver have any physical disabilities or injuries, such as a bad back or bad knees, which affect the driver’s ability to perform the tests, thereby making them unreliable and inadmissible.</li>
<li>Is the officer qualified to perform the specific Field Sobriety Test? Some Field Sobriety tests, such as the HGN test (eye following pen test), may only be relied upon when conducted by certified alcohol recognition experts. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></li>
<li>Were all of the tests deemed reliable by the courts. Some tests, such as the  reverse alphabet test, are not admissible in court.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="insufficient-probable-cause">Insufficient Probable Cause</h3>
<p>In order to arrest a driver for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>, an officer must have probable cause to believe that a driver was under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances to the extent that the driver’s normal faculties were impaired.</p>
<p>If it can be shown that the officer’s probable cause conclusion was based on insufficient evidence or an unreasonable conclusion, then the driver’s arrest will be deemed illegal and any subsequent evidence will be suppressed, resulting in the prosecutor dismissing the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Example of Insufficient Probable Cause</h4>
<p>Sometimes an officer’s sole reason to arrest a driver for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> is based on the odor of alcohol.</p>
<p>However, the odor of alcohol by itself has been ruled an insufficient reason for an officer to believe that a driver is “under the influence” of alcoholic beverages to justify an arrest for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h4>Example of Unreasonable Probable Cause</h4>
<p>If video of the Field Sobriety Tests objectively reveals that the driver performed satisfactorily in contradiction to the officer’s written report, many judges will find the officer’s conclusion that the person was impaired to be unreasonable.</p>
<p>As a result, the judge will suppress the arrest evidence and any subsequently obtained evidence, forcing the prosecutor to dismiss the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="inadmissible-breath-results">Inadmissible Breath Results</h3>
<p>The Breathalyzer machines used by law enforcement are tightly regulated and subject to strict maintenance requirements in order to be deemed admissible. Additionally, the testing must be done in a very specific, standardized manner.</p>
<p>The failure to either properly maintain the machines or to conduct the tests in accordance with required procedures can result in the breath alcohol results being ruled inadmissible, no matter how high the breath alcohol results were.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>The failure of an officer to perform any of these simple steps may result in the breath alcohol results being thrown out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the officer conduct a 20 minutes straight observation prior to administering the breath alcohol test?</li>
<li>Did the officer instruct the driver to “keep blowing” during the breath test?</li>
<li>Did the officer calibrate the machine properly prior to conducting the breath alcohol test?</li>
<li>Did the officer read Florida’s Implied Consent Law or incorrectly state the law?</li>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">DUI Manslaughter in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">DUI Manslaughter is a Second Degree Felony.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/316.193">Florida Statute 316.193(1) and (3)(c)(3)</a>, the crime of <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Manslaughter is committed in Florida when a person:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drives a vehicle, or is found to be in actual physical control of a vehicle, within the state of Florida;</li>
<li>And the person is either:
						<ol type="a">
<li>Under the influence of alcoholic beverages or any chemical or controlled substance, when affected to the extent that the person’s normal faculties are impaired; or</li>
<li>Has a breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher; or</li>
<li>Has a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>And causes the death of another person, either directly or indirectly.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Actual Physical Control</h3>
<p>Actual Physical Control means a person must be physically in or, in the case of a motorcycle, on the vehicle and have the capability to operate the vehicle, regardless of whether the person is actually operating the vehicle at the time.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for DUI Manslaughter</h2>
<p>The crime of <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Manslaughter is a Second Degree Felony and assigned a Level 8 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.</p>
<p>If convicted of <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Manslaughter in Florida, a judge is required to impose a mandatory-minimum sentence of 124½ months in prison in addition to the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to fifteen years in prison.</li>
<li>Up to fifteen years of probation.</li>
<li>Up to $10,000 in fines.</li>
<li>Permanent driver’s license revocation.</li>
<li>Community service.</li>
<li>Impoundment of the driver’s vehicle.</li>
<li>Completion of a <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Substance Abuse Course.</li>
<li>Completion of a psychosocial evaluation and substance abuse treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mandatory Minimum Sentence Requirement</h3>
<p>DUI Manslaughter is one of the rare crimes where a downward departure sentence may be justified because of mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense. If a judge finds a basis to impose a downward departure sentence, the judge can impose a sentence below the presumptively required sentence of 124 ½ months in prison.</p>
<p>However, a judge’s ability to impose a downward departure sentence is capped by <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/316.193">Florida Statute 316.193(3)(c)(3)</a>, which requires a person convicted of DUI manslaughter to be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of 4 years imprisonment.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to DUI Manslaughter</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common evidentiary defenses that are raised in a <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> Manslaughter case are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#illegal-traffic-stop">Illegal Traffic Stop</a></li>
<li><a href="#improper-field-sobriety-tests">Improper Field Sobriety Tests</a></li>
<li><a href="#insufficient-probable-cause">Insufficient Probable Cause</a></li>
<li><a href="#inadmissible-breath-results">Inadmissible Breath Results</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="illegal-traffic-stop">Illegal Traffic Stop</h3>
<p>The law is very clear that a law enforcement officer may only stop a vehicle for one of two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the driver is committing a traffic infraction; or </li>
<li>If the officer has probable cause that the driver committed a crime.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, many times it can be shown that the officer was mistaken in his reason for conducting a traffic stop. If this is proven, all of the evidence obtained as a result of the illegal stop is suppressed and the prosecutor is forced to dismiss the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> case.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Example of Illegal Traffic Stop</h4>
<p>An officer stops a vehicle for an expired license plate and subsequently arrested the driver for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>.</p>
<p>If it can be shown that the officer was mistaken in his conclusion that the license plate was expired, the judge will find that the officer made an illegal stop and suppress any evidence obtained as a result of the traffic stop. This will force the prosecutor to dismiss the DUI case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="improper-field-sobriety-tests">Improper Field Sobriety Tests</h3>
<p>In most <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> cases, law enforcement will administer Field Sobriety Tests prior to arresting the driver. The purpose of these tests is supposedly to assist the officer in determining whether a person is impaired.</p>
		And while everyone knows that the tests are designed to make a person fail, there are several avenues to challenging the officer’s testimony about these tests:
		<ol>
<li>Is the officer familiar with the driver’s true balance and coordination?</li>
<li>Does the driver have any physical disabilities or injuries, such as a bad back or bad knees, which affect the driver’s ability to perform the tests, thereby making them unreliable and inadmissible.</li>
<li>Is the officer qualified to perform the specific Field Sobriety Test? Some Field Sobriety tests, such as the HGN test (eye following pen test), may only be relied upon when conducted by certified alcohol recognition experts. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></li>
<li>Were all of the tests deemed reliable by the courts. Some tests, such as the  reverse alphabet test, are not admissible in court.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="insufficient-probable-cause">Insufficient Probable Cause</h3>
<p>In order to arrest a driver for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>, an officer must have probable cause to believe that a driver was under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances to the extent that the driver’s normal faculties were impaired.</p>
<p>If it can be shown that the officer’s probable cause conclusion was based on insufficient evidence or an unreasonable conclusion, then the driver’s arrest will be deemed illegal and any subsequent evidence will be suppressed, resulting in the prosecutor dismissing the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Example of Insufficient Probable Cause</h4>
<p>Sometimes an officer’s sole reason to arrest a driver for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> is based on the odor of alcohol.</p>
<p>However, the odor of alcohol by itself has been ruled an insufficient reason for an officer to believe that a driver is “under the influence” of alcoholic beverages to justify an arrest for <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h4>Example of Unreasonable Probable Cause</h4>
<p>If video of the Field Sobriety Tests objectively reveals that the driver performed satisfactorily in contradiction to the officer’s written report, many judges will find the officer’s conclusion that the person was impaired to be unreasonable.</p>
<p>As a result, the judge will suppress the arrest evidence and any subsequently obtained evidence, forcing the prosecutor to dismiss the <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="inadmissible-breath-results">Inadmissible Breath Results</h3>
<p>The Breathalyzer machines used by law enforcement are tightly regulated and subject to strict maintenance requirements in order to be deemed admissible. Additionally, the testing must be done in a very specific, standardized manner.</p>
<p>The failure to either properly maintain the machines or to conduct the tests in accordance with required procedures can result in the breath alcohol results being ruled inadmissible, no matter how high the breath alcohol results were.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>The failure of an officer to perform any of these simple steps may result in the breath alcohol results being thrown out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the officer conduct a 20 minutes straight observation prior to administering the breath alcohol test?</li>
<li>Did the officer instruct the driver to “keep blowing” during the breath test?</li>
<li>Did the officer calibrate the machine properly prior to conducting the breath alcohol test?</li>
<li>Did the officer read Florida’s Implied Consent Law or incorrectly state the law?</li>
</ul>

Consequently, victim death points are not presumptively required by the sentencing guidelines because the death was not caused by the act of leaving the scene. <small>[<a href="#references">1</a>]</small></p>
<p>However, if the State proves the victim’s death was due to a delay in emergency services being contacted, victim death points can be included in the sentencing guidelines calculation and may result in an increased minimum prison sentence.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Leaving the Scene of an Accident</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific or common defenses to the crime of Leaving the Scene of an Accident include:</p>
<h3>Lack of Knowledge</h3>
<p>While it should probably go without saying, knowledge of the accident is an essential element, as one cannot “willfully” leave an accident without awareness that an accident has occurred. This situation usually occurs where someone slightly hits a car while backing up, but does not feel the impact. Under this situation, one can argue they were unaware they ever impacted another vehicle. <small>[<a href="#references">2</a>]</small></p>
<p>Likewise, to be convicted of the enhanced crime of Leaving the Scene of an Accident causing Injury or Death, the prosecution must prove either actual or constructive knowledge of the injury or death. Without such proof, the most a person could be convicted of is misdemeanor Leaving the Scene of an Accident.</p>
<h3>Physically Unable to Report</h3>
<p>If, because of the crash or injury, you were rendered physically incapacitated and unable to report the crash or accident; you are exempt from fulfilling the requirement to leave your name, address, registration information, and driver’s license to the owner of the property.</p>
<h3>Undamaged Property</h3>
<p>It is legal to leave the scene of a collision with property, such as a tree or curb, that was not damaged. <small>[<a href="#references">3</a>]</small> Notwithstanding this, many police officers will still arrest and charge people with Leaving the Scene of an Accident for colliding with property that was not damaged.</p>

<blockquote class="half">There are four categories of Trespass crimes in Florida.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">There are four categories of Trespass crimes in Florida:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#trespass_on_property">Trespass on Property</a></li>
<li><a href="#trespass_on_school_grounds">Trespass on School Grounds</a></li>
<li><a href="#trespass_in_structure">Trespass in a Structure</a></li>
<li><a href="#trespass_in_conveyance">Trespass in a Conveyance</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="definition">Definition of Trespass</h2>
<p>Under Chapter 810 of the Florida Statutes, the crime of Trespass is committed when a person:</p>
<ol>
<li>willfully enters or remains on some form of real property without authorization, license, or invitation; or</li>
<li>Returns to or ignores a prior warning to stay off real property.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Trespass</h2>
<p>The penalties for the crime of Trespass depend on which type of Trespass you are charged with:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="trespass-on-property.html#penalties">Trespass on Property</a></li>
<li><a href="trespass-on-school-grounds.html#penalties">Trespass on School Grounds</a></li>

<li><a href="trespass-in-conveyance.html#penalties">Trespass in a Conveyance</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Trespass</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, some specific defenses to the crime of Trespass include:</p>
<h3>Consent</h3>
<p>Consent to enter is not an element of Trespass, but is an affirmative defense to the crime. A defendant has the burden to offer evidence of consent. But once evidence of consent is presented, the prosecutor must disprove the consent to enter beyond a reasonable doubt. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>Consent is usually raised when there are multiple people who exercise authority over the property, one of whom gave consent to enter or use it to a defendant. Under such circumstance a defendant cannot be convicted of burglary just because the other people were unaware that authorization was given.</p>
<h3>Open to the Public</h3>
<p>If an establishment is “open to the public” a person by definition has consensually entered a business, no matter what the subjective intentions for entering were. As a result, the right to “remain inside” is implied unless the State has proof that the implied consent to “remain inside” was withdrawn. So if a defendant commits a crime inside (such as theft or robbery) the defendant cannot also be convicted of Trespass. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h4>Off Limits or Employee Only Area</h4>
<p>The “Open to the Public” defense does not apply to an off limits or employee only area of a business and a Trespass conviction will be upheld if such an area is entered. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Trespass on Property in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">The crime of Trespass on Property can be committed in one of two ways.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/810.09">Florida Statute 810.08</a>, the crime of Trespass on Property is committed when a person:</p>
<ol>
<li>willfully enters or remains on any property other than a structure or conveyance without being authorized, licensed, or invited when notice against entering or remaining is given, either by actual communication or by posting, fencing, or cultivation; or</li>
<li>willfully enters or remains on the unenclosed curtilage of a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime thereon, without authorization, license, or invitation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unenclosed curtilage is defined as the unenclosed land or grounds, and any outbuildings, that are directly and intimately adjacent to and connected with the dwelling and necessary, convenient, and habitually used in connection with the dwelling.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Trespass on Property</h2>
<p>The crime of Trespass on Property is a First Degree Misdemeanor in Florida.</p>
<p>If convicted of Trespass on Property, a judge can impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to sixty (60) days in jail.</li>
<li>Up to six (6) months of probation.</li>
<li>Up to $500 in fines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Felony Trespass on Property</h3>
<p>Trespass on Property is enhanced to a Third Degree Felony if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The accused is armed with a firearm or other dangerous weapon;</li>
<li>The accused hunts an endangered, fur bearing, or game animal;</li>
<li>The area is a posted construction site;</li>
<li>The area is a posted agricultural site for testing or research purposes;</li>
<li>The area is a posted domestic violence center; or</li>
<li>The area is a posted agricultural chemicals manufacturing facility.</li>
</ul>
<p>The crime of Felony Trespass on Property is a Level 3 Offense under Florida’s Criminal Punishment Code.</p>
<p>If convicted of Felony Trespass on Property, a judge can impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to five (5) years in jail.</li>
<li>Up to five (5) years of probation.</li>
<li>Up to $5,000 in fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Trespass on Property</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Trespass on Property include:</p>
<h3>Improper Posting</h3>
<p>If the Trespass on Property charge is based on the posting of “No Trespassing” signs, the signs must conform to the specific posting requirements of Florida Statute 810.011 or the land is not properly posted and a conviction for Trespass on Property will not survive. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h3>Lack of Intent</h3>
<p>One of the elements necessary to support a conviction for Trespass on Property is the intent to unlawfully trespass on the property. Usually this is proven by showing that a person entered stealthily.</p>
<p>But if a person can show they thought entry onto the property was permissible, a conviction for Trespass on Property will not stand because the trespass cannot be considered to have been done willfully.</p>
<h3>Landlord-Tenant Conflict</h3>
<p>Absent restrictions in a lease agreement, a landlord cannot enforce a trespass warning against a person a tenant has invited onto the property. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>Such a situation frequently arises when a person is trespassed from an apartment complex by an property management agent and trespassed person is subsequently invited back by a tenant of the apartment complex. Under such circumstances, the person is not trespassing, because the tenant’s invitation superceded the property management’s trespass warning.</p>
<h3>Stale Trespass Warning</h3>
<p>Where there is property that has multiple owners, a previous trespass warning cannot be the basis of a Trespass on Property charge if you are subsequently invited or allowed back on by a different owner or a person with greater authority.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Weapons and Firearms Crimes in Florida</h1>
<p itemprop="description">Florida criminalizes numerous acts that involve the possession, purchase, or use of weapons or firearms.</p>
<p>Below are links to explanations for some of the most commonly charged weapons and firearms offenses.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#carrying_concealed_firearm">Carrying a Concealed Firearm</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Weapons Offenses versus Weapons Enhancements</h2>
<p>It is important to note that this section only deals with weapons and firearms specific crimes. Meaning offenses that constitute separate crimes solely because a person improperly possessed, purchased, or used a weapon or firearm.</p>
<p>This should be distinguished from what are known as weapons and firearm enhancements.</p>
<p>Enhancements either increase the penalties for a crime or require minimum-mandatory prison sentences when a weapon or firearm is used in the commission of a crime such as <a href="#assault_aggravated_assault">aggravated assault</a>, <a href="#battery_aggravated_battery">aggravated battery</a>, <a href="#theft_robbery">robbery</a>, and other violent crimes.</p>
<p>The most commonly know weapons or firearms enhancement in Florida is known as 10-20-Life, which triggers minimum-mandatory prison sentences if a firearm is carried, discharged, or a person is shot or killed with a firearm while in the commission of certain violent crimes.</p>
<h3>10-20-Life Minimum-Mandatory Sentences</h3>
<img alt="Florida's 10-20-Life Infographic" class="bc scale-with-grid" src="##Library/images/10-20-Life.gif"/>
<ul>
<li>Firearm carried; 10 year minimum-mandatory prison sentence.</li>
<li>Firearm discharged; 20 year minimum-mandatory prison sentence.</li>
<li>A person is shot or killed; 25 year minimum-mandatory prison sentence, up to life in prison.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Florida Law versus Federal Law</h2>
<p>It is also important to know that both Florida law and Federal law apply to the purchase, possession, or use of certain weapons and all firearms.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are multiple Federal laws that criminalizes the purchase, possession, or use of a firearm even though Florida does not.</p>
<h2>Gun Owners and Weapon Enthusiasts</h2>
<p>If you are a gun owner, weapons enthusiast, or weapons dealer in Florida and in need of specialized advice regarding Florida firearm or weapons law, use, or ownership, I highly suggest you contact <a href="https://www.floridafirearmslaw.com/">attorney Jon Gutmacher</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Gutmacher is the author of <a href="https://www.floridafirearmslaw.com/facts-about-the-florida-gun-law-book-2/">Florida Firearms Law, Use, &amp; Ownership</a>, which I turn to whenever I am have a specific question about Florida weapons or firearms law.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Carrying a Concealed Firearm in Florida</h1>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/790.01">Florida Statute 790.01(2)</a>, the crime of Carrying a Concealed Firearm is committed when a person knowingly carries, on or about their person, a firearm that is concealed from the ordinary sight of another person without a valid license to carry a concealed firearm.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Carrying a Concealed Firearm</h2>
<p>The crime of Carrying a Concealed Firearm is a Third Degree Felony and is assigned a Level 5 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.</p>
<p>If convicted of Carrying a Concealed Firearm, a judge can impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to five (5) years in prison.</li>
<li>Up to five (5) years of probation.</li>
<li>Up to $5,000 in fines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Carrying a Concealed Firearm</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, specific defenses to the crime of Carrying a Concealed Firearm are:</p>
<h3>Concealed Weapons Permit</h3>
<p>A person who possesses a license to carry a concealed weapon or a concealed firearm (commonly referred to as a Concealed Weapons Permit) issued by the State of Florida is immune from prosecution for Carrying a Concealed Firearm. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>Additionally, Florida allows out-of-sate visitors who are licensed to carry concealed weapons or firearms in their home state, the right to carry concealed weapons or firearms in Florida provided the other state offers <a href="https://www.fdacs.gov/Consumer-Resources/Concealed-Weapon-License/Concealed-Weapon-License-Reciprocity">concealed carry reciprocity</a>.</p>
<p>Importantly, prior to 2015, possession of a license to carry a concealed firearm was an affirmative defense, that the defendant had to prove. However, in 2015, the Florida Legislature amended the law to require the prosecutor to prove the defendant did not possess a license to carry a concealed firearm as an element of the crime of Carrying a Concealed Firearm. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h3>Exempted Activity</h3>
<p>Florida law provides for several limited exemptions which allow a person to lawfully carry a concealed firearm without a Concealed Weapons Permit. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>These exemptions are primarily related to carrying a firearm as a law enforcement or security officer, but also include civilian activities such as traveling to or from a fishing, camping, or lawful hunting event; transporting a firearm within a private residence; and traveling to or from a gun show or firearms club.</p>
<h3>Home or “Place of Business” Exemption</h3>
<p>A person may lawfully carry a concealed firearm around their home or “Place of Business.” <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small> A “Place of Business” includes a place where a person is employed or a trade union, or professional or business organization that the person is a member of. <small><a href="#references">[5]</a></small></p>
<h3>Private Conveyance Exception</h3>
<p>So long as the firearm is not on your person, a concealed firearm may be kept within the interior of a private vehicle without a permit provided the firearm is either “securely encased or otherwise not readily accessible for immediate use.” <small><a href="#references">[6]</a></small></p>
<h4>Securely Encased</h4>
<p>Securely encased is defined as being in a glove compartment, whether or not locked; snapped in a holster; in a gun case, whether or not locked; in a zippered gun case; or in a closed box or container which requires a lid or cover to be opened for access. <small><a href="#references">[7]</a></small></p>
<h4>Not Readily Accessible</h4>
<p>Whether a firearm is “readily accessible for immediate use” (such as underneath the seat), is determined by when the accused made contact with law enforcement (or the complaining witness).</p>
<p>If the person was already out of the car when approached by law enforcement, then a firearm found underneath a car seat is not considered to be illegally concealed. <small><a href="#references">[7]</a></small> On the other hand, if a person is in the car when approached by law enforcement and a firearm is found underneath the seat, the firearm is considered to be illegally concealed. <small><a href="#references">[8]</a></small> </p>

<h3>Definition of a Weapon</h3>
<p>A weapon is defined as any dirk, metallic knuckles, sling-shot, billie club, tear gas gun, chemical weapon or device, or other deadly weapon.</p>
<p>The phrase “other deadly weapon” is a commonly litigated issue, because a wide variety of objects that are not commonly considered weapons can be alleged to be a “deadly weapon.”</p>
<p>In such cases it will be up to the jury to decide whether an object was being carried as a weapon or for its traditional use.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Carrying a Concealed Weapon</h2>
<p>The crime of Carrying a Concealed Weapon is a First Degree Misdemeanor. If convicted of Carrying a Concealed Weapon, a judge can impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>

<h3>Self Defense Products</h3>
<p>It is a defense to the crime of Carrying a Concealed Weapon if the object was carried for purposes of lawful self-defense and is recognized as a lawful Self Defense Product.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/790.06">Florida Statute 790.06(12)</a>, the crime of Carrying a Weapon or Firearm in a Prohibited Place is committed when a person openly carries a handgun or knowingly and willfully carries a concealed weapon or concealed firearm in a place where carrying a weapon or firearm is prohibited by Florida or federal law regardless of whether the person possesses a concealed weapons permit.</p>
<h3>Definition of Prohibited Places</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/790.06">Florida Statute 790.06(12)(a)</a> defines a prohibited place as:</p>
<img alt="No Weapons Beyond this Point" class="bc" height="192" src="##Library/images/stock/no-weapons-beyond-this-point.jpg" width="341"/>
<ul>
<li>Any place of nuisance (i.e. illegal gambling hall, brothel, or drug house).</li>

<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Carrying a Firearm in Prohibited Place</h2>

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/790.23">Florida Statute 790.23</a>, the crime of Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon occurs when a convicted felon knowingly cares for, controls, possesses, or owns a firearm.</p>
<h3>Possession: Actual versus Constructive</h3>
<p>An important issue in determining the ultimate sentence for the crime of Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon is whether the person <a href="#actual-possession">actually possessed</a> the firearm or <a href="#constructive-possession">constructively possessed</a> the firearm; as Actual Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon carries a three-year <a href="#minimum-mandatory">minimum-mandatory prison sentence</a>.</p>
<h4 id="actual-possession">Actual Possession</h4>
<p>Actual possession occurs if the firearm is:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the hand of or on the person; or</li>
<li>In a container in the hand of or on the person; or</li>
<li>So close as to be within ready reach and is under the control of the person.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h4>
<p>Constructive possession occurs if the firearm is in a place over which the accused person has control, or in which the accused person has concealed it.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon</h2>
<p>The crime of Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon is a Second Degree Felony and is assigned a Level 5 offense severity ranking under Florida’s <a href="#criminal_sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-mandatory">Actual Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon</h3>
<p>Under Florida’s 10-20-Life law  <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small>, a felon found to be in the actual possession of a firearm is required to serve a three-year minimum mandatory sentence; regardless of whether the person scores prison.</p>
<p>If convicted of Actual Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon, a judge is required to impose a minimum-mandatory sentence of three-years in prison and can also impose any combination of the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to fifteen (15) years in prison.</li>
<li>Up to fifteen (15) years of probation.</li>
<li>Up to $10,000 in fines.</li>

<h3>Exempted Device</h3>
<p>A Destructive Device does not include: <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<ol>
<li>A device which is not designed, redesigned, used, or intended for use as a weapon;</li>

<h1 itemprop="name">Florida Pretrial and Trial Criminal Defenses</h1>
<p>Whether a <a href="#clients_first_time_offenders">first time offender</a> or a repeat offender, your criminal case can be challenged on constitutional, statutory, or administrative grounds.</p>
<p>In general, these various defenses fall into the category of either a <a href="#Pretrial">Pretrial Defense</a> or <a href="#Trial">Trial Defense</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Pretrial">Pretrial Defenses</h2>
<p>Pretrial defenses are raised prior to trial and are used to challenge the legality of how the evidence against you was obtained and the sufficiency of the evidence used to charge you with a crime.</p>
<p>The most common Pretrial Defenses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Illegal Search and Seizure</li>
<li><a href="#self_defense">Self Defense</a></li>
<li><a href="#speedy_trial">Speedy Trial Violation</a></li>
<li><a href="#statute_of_limitations">Statute of Limitations</a></li>
<li>Warrantless Stop</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, these pretrial defenses are raised through either a:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#motion_to_suppress">Motion to Suppress</a> or</li>
<li><a href="#motion_to_dismiss">Motion to Dismiss</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Not every available defense will result in the outright dismissal of a case; but the prosecution needs all of its evidence to prove a crime, prevent an appeal, and build a strong case for trial.</p>
<p>So if one link in the State’s case is successfully challenged at the pretrial stage, resulting in key evidence being  being thrown out (suppressed), the State may be unable to prosecute you as charged, be forced to negotiate a favorable plea, or be unable to prove their case at trial beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<blockquote class="half">In criminal defense, winning one motion can result in winning your case.</blockquote>
<h2 id="Trial">Trial Defenses</h2>
<p>As the name implies, trial defenses are raised during the actual trial and either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Raise an <a href="#Affirmative">Affirmative Defense</a> to a Crime; or</li>
<li>Challenge the <a href="#Insufficient-Evidence">Sufficiency of the Evidence</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Affirmative">Affirmative Defenses</h3>
<p>Under certain circumstances, Florida law allows a person to raise an Affirmative Defense, which does not deny that an offense occurred, but that the conduct was legally justified.</p>
<p>The most common Affirmative Defenses are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#advice_of_counsel">Advice of Counsel</a></li>
<li>Alibi</li>
<li><a href="#duress">Duress</a></li>
<li>Entrapment</li>
<li>Insanity</li>
<li>Necessity</li>
<li><a href="#self_defense">Self Defense</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When an Affirmative Defense is raised, the defendant must present some evidence to support the defense. If such evidence is presented, the burden shift back to the State to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense is not applicable.</p>
<h3 id="Insufficient-Evidence">Insufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>By far, the most common trial defense is that a case cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>And not only must the prosecutor prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, each element of the crime charged must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. So if a pretrial defense was granted, the State may have a difficult time proving an element of a crime at trial.</p>

<h1>Defense of Duress in Florida</h1>
<p>The defense of duress can be used in Florida if a person can establish the following six elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The defendant reasonably believed a danger existed which was not intentionally caused by himself;</li>
<li>The danger threatened significant harm to himself;</li>
<li>The threatened harm must have been real, imminent, and impending.</li>
<li>The defendant had no reasonable means to avoid the danger except by committing the crime charged</li>
<li>The crime charged must have been committed out of duress to avoid the danger; and</li>
<li>The harm that the defendant avoided must outweigh the harm caused by committing the crime charged</li>

<h1 itemprop="name">Motion to Dismiss</h1>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, motions to dismiss are infrequently granted in criminal cases. The reason is that unlike in a civil case, a prosecutor only needs to satisfy a probable cause standard in order to present their case to a jury.</p>
<p>Also, even if every witness the State lists is a known liar, the credibility of the witness cannot be challenged through a motion to dismiss, but must be decided by a jury.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are three common grounds upon which a Motion to Dismiss can be filed.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Motion to Dismiss based Upon <a href="#self_defense">Self Defense</a></dt>
<dd>A Motion to Dismiss alleging you lawfully defended yourself under Florida law.</dd>
<dt>Motion to Dismiss on Factual Grounds</dt>
<dd>A factual Motion to Dismiss alleges that the undisputed facts being alleged against you do not support a crime under Florida law.</dd>
<dt>Motion to Dismiss for Violation of the <a href="#statute_of_limitations">Statute of Limitations</a></dt>
<dd>A Motion to Dismiss for Violation of the <a href="#statute_of_limitations">Statute of Limitations</a> alleges that too much time has passed between the commission of the alleged crime and the current prosecution.</dd>
<dt>Motion to Dismiss for Violation of Speedy Trial</dt>
<dd>The final basis is a Motion to Dismiss for violation of the Speedy Trial Rule and can be filed when the State has failed to bring you to trial within a specific period of time with no fault of the delay being attributable to you.</dd>

<h1 itemprop="name">Motion to Suppress</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Courts suppress illegally obtained evidence to deter police misconduct.</blockquote>
<p>A motion to suppress seeks to exclude evidence from being used against you because it was obtained through police or governmental misconduct.</p>
<p>A successful challenge can result in key evidence being thrown out or an outright dismissal of the charges.</p>
<h2>Why Courts Suppress Evidence</h2>
<p>Courts suppress illegally obtained evidence to deter police misconduct so law enforcement is not rewarded for obtaining evidence illegally.</p>
<p>Known as the Exclusionary Rule <small><a href="#FN1">[1]</a></small>, it is believed that law enforcement will conduct themselves appropriately in the future if they know the illegally obtained evidence will not be admissible at trial.</p>
<h2>Types of Motions to Suppress</h2>
<p>There are several types of motions to suppress that can be filed in a criminal case. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Warrantless-Search-or-Seizure">Motion to Suppress Warrantless Search or Seizure</a></li>
<li><a href="#Statements">Motion to Suppress Statements</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Warrantless-Search-or-Seizure">Motion to Suppress Warrantless Search or Seizure</h3>
<p>The most common basis for filing a motion to suppress is when law enforcement conduct a warrantless search or seizure of your person, home, or vehicle in violation of your fourth amendment right to be free from unlawful searches or seizures.</p>
<h3 id="Statements">Motion to Suppress Statements</h3>
<p>Another common piece of evidence that can be attacked is a confession or an incriminating statement.</p>
<p>Generally, statements are suppressed for being obtained without informing a suspect of the <a href="#Miranda-Rights">right to remain silent</a> or as a result of coercion.</p>
<h4 id="Miranda-Rights">Miranda Rights</h4>
<p>“Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law...” is probably one of the most well known phrases in the United States. But contrary to popular belief, a law enforcement officer does not have to read you your rights whenever they encounter you.</p>
<p>Rather, a law enforcement officer only has to read you your rights when you are under arrest or if you are not free to leave. Once an officer reads you your rights you should politely decline to speak with him any further and request an attorney.</p>
<p>The biggest exception to your right to remain silent occurs when you make a spontaneous statement. Any spontaneous statements you make before or after being read your rights can be used against you, regardless if other statements are thrown out due to illegal police misconduct.</p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Self Defense in Florida</h1>
<p>In Florida, Self Defense is referred to as the justifiable use of force. In simple terms, the defense allows a person to use force, sometimes deadly force, to protect one’s self, one’s property, or another person, so long as the force used is proportionate to the threat faced.</p>
<blockquote class="half">A person who is attacked has no duty to retreat.</blockquote>
<h2>Florida’s Stand Your Ground Law</h2>
<p>Traditionally, if a person was anywhere but their home, the Self Defense law required a person to attempt to first retreat before engaging an aggressor. And to further complicate matters, the defense could only be raised at trial. But in October of 2005, Florida passed the Stand Your Ground Law, which dramatically changed the legal landscape of self defense law.</p>
<p>Under the Stand Your Ground Law, a person who is attacked has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand their ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if it is reasonably believed necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.</p>
<p>Also, the Stand Your Ground Law now allows a person to raise the issue of Self Defense both at a Pretrial Hearing and at trial. As a result, if a judge finds that your actions were justified, the Judge is required to dismiss the charges and no trial is required. If the judge does not find your actions were justified, the defense can still be presented to a jury and they can make their own independent determination of whether your actions were justified.</p>
<h2>Justifiable Use of Deadly Force</h2>
<p>A person is justified in the use of deadly force and does not have a duty to retreat if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is reasonably believed that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony (i.e. Robbery).</li>
<li>It is being used against a person who is unlawfully and forcefully breaking in, or has unlawfully and forcibly broken into a dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exception to the Use of Deadly Force</h3>
<p>Deadly Force cannot be used against:</p>

<li>A lawful resident of the dwelling, residence, or vehicle, such as an owner, lessee, or titleholder (Unless there is a restraining order in place).</li>
<li>A parent who is retrieving a child or grandchild for whom they have lawful custody (Meaning you can't shoot an ex-spouse who is picking up children for the weekend and then claim they broke in.)</li>
<li>The person who uses defensive force is engaged in unlawful activity or using the dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle to further an unlawful activity.</li>

<h1 itemprop="name">Statute of Limitations in Florida</h1>
<p>The Statute of Limitations sets the maximum time period in which a criminal prosecution can be commenced. If the prosecution is not commenced within the time period, the charges are subject to being dismissed.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind the Statute of Limitations is that the more time that passes, the more difficult it would be to locate witnesses, gather evidence, or remember events.</p>
<p>In Florida, a person only needs to be notified within the statutory time period that formal criminal charges have been filed to satisfy the Statute of Limitations. There is no requirement that a person actually receive a trial within the statutory time period.</p>
<h2>Tolling of Statute of Limitations</h2>
<p>In Florida, the Statute of Limitations is tolled (meaning it does not run) during any time that a person is continuously absent from the state or has no reasonably ascertainable residence or place of employment within Florida.</p>
<blockquote class="half">In Florida, the Statute of Limitations is tolled during any time that a person is continuously absent from the state.</blockquote>

<h1 itemprop="name">Criminal Trial Defenses</h1>
<p>As the name implies, trial defenses are raised during the actual trial and either:</p>
<blockquote class="half">The most common trial defense is that a case cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Raise an <a href="#affirmative-defense">Affirmative Defense</a>; or</li>
<li>Challenge the <a href="#insufficient-evidence">Sufficiency of the Evidence</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="affirmative-defense">Affirmative Defenses</h2>
<p>Under certain circumstances, Florida law allows a person to raise an Affirmative Defense, which does not deny that an offense occurred, but that the conduct was legally justified.</p>
<p>The most common Affirmative Defenses are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#advice_of_counsel">Advice of Counsel</a></li>
<li>Alibi</li>
<li><a href="#duress">Duress</a></li>
<li>Entrapment</li>
<li>Insanity</li>
<li>Necessity</li>
<li><a href="#self_defense">Self Defense</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, when an Affirmative Defense is raised, the defendant must present some evidence to support the defense. If such evidence is presented, the burden shift back to the State to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense is not applicable.</p>
<h2 id="insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</h2>
<p>By far, the most common trial defense is that a case cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>And not only must the prosecutor prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, each element of the crime charged must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. So if a pretrial defense was granted, the State may have a difficult time proving an element of a crime at trial.</p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Options to Resolving a Criminal Case</h1>
<p>Every client wants their case dismissed, but dismissal is not always a realistic option. And when dismissal is not an option, the client must ask how are they willing to resolve their case.</p>
<p>The answer usually boils down to a question of risk. Because, in a criminal case you must ask yourself: <strong>“Are you willing to risk going to jail?”</strong></p>
<p>For many, the answer is easy - diversion or a plea agreement. For others, the answer is difficult because the evidence is weak. And for a select few, the answer is obvious; anything short of an outright acquittal is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Finally, because diversionary programs and plea agreements require the prosecutor’s cooperation, I usually advise clients to pursue them first. As we can always reinitiate litigation or elect a trial later if we decide against a diversionary program or plea.</p>
<p>In general, there are four options a client will have to choose from:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#diversion-programs">Diversion Programs</a>
<ul class="disc">
<li><a href="#pretrial-diversion">Pretrial Diversion</a></li>
<li><a href="#pretrial-intervention">Pretrial Intervention</a></li>
<li><a href="#drug-court">Drug Court</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#plea-negotiations">Plea Negotiations</a></li>
<li><a href="#litigation">Litigation</a>
<ul class="disc">
<li><a href="#dismissal">Dismissal</a></li>
<li><a href="#suppression">Suppression</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#trial">Trial</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="diversion-programs">Diversion Programs</h2>
<p>In general, diversion programs are similar to being place on probation; as you have to report monthly, attend short classes, and complete community service. However, they have two great benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>You do not have to admit any guilt, and</li>
<li><strong>The charges are dismissed upon successful completion!</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="pretrial-diversion">Pretrial Diversion</h3>
<p>Pretrial Diversion (<abbr title="Pretrial Diversion">PTD</abbr>) is a diversionary program run by the State Attorney’s Office and is usually reserved for first time, nonviolent offenders.</p>
<p><abbr title="Pretrial Diversion">PTD</abbr> is similar to probation, in that once you are accepted into the program you must report monthly to a supervising officer, undergo random drug testing, complete community service hours, and refrain from being involved in any criminal activity.</p>
<p>Additionally, Pretrial Diversion requires the permission of the victim in your case (if there is one). Your charges will be dropped upon successful completion of the <abbr title="Pretrial Diversion">PTD</abbr> program.</p>
<p>The length of <abbr title="Pretrial Diversion">PTD</abbr> depends on the seriousness of your charges and how quickly you can complete the program’s requirements. Generally, <abbr title="Pretrial Diversion">PTD</abbr> lasts a minimum of six (6) months for misdemeanor cases and twelve (12) months for felony cases.</p>
<h3 id="pretrial-intervention">Pretrial Intervention</h3>
<p>Pretrial Intervention (<abbr title="Pretrial Intervention">PTI</abbr>) is similar to <abbr title="Pretrial Diversion">PTD</abbr> but is open to repeat offenders. Once accepted into <abbr title="Pretrial Intervention">PTI</abbr> you must report monthly, undergo a drug evaluation and treatment, complete other requirements ordered by the court (i.e. community service or donation), and refrain from being re-arrested. Your charges will be dropped upon successful completion of the <abbr title="Pretrial Intervention">PTI</abbr> program.</p>
<p>Importantly, even though you may be eligible for <abbr title="Pretrial Intervention">PTI</abbr>, many attorneys are unfamiliar with the program because it is only offered by certain prosecutors or judges. As a result it is important to hire an attorney familiar with the individual prosecutors and judges to insure you are properly referred.</p>
<h3 id="drug-court">Drug Court</h3>
<p>Drug Court is a diversion program for repeat drug offenders and people who have an intense drug addiction. Drug Court can last up to 36 months (but can be completed in as little as nine months) and includes intensive drug treatment and group therapy. </p>
<h2 id="plea-negotiations">Plea Negotiations</h2>
<p>If you are ineligible for (or unwilling to enter) a diversion program, chances are I can still resolve your case with minimal sanctions. This resolution will usually include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Withholding the Formal Adjudication of Guilt</li>
<li>Probation</li>
<li>Reduced Charges or Dismissed Counts</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="litigation">Litigation</h2>
<p>If you (or the prosecutor) are unwilling to negotiate, we will litigate your case fully. I would utilize the following proceedings to work towards the result you want.</p>
<h3 id="suppression"><a href="#motion_to_suppress">Motion to Suppress</a></h3>
<p>Police must have probable cause, or valid consent, to stop and search you or your home. However, police are notorious for searching people on less than probable cause or under coerced consent.</p>
<p>Even though you might think the police acted lawfully, I may still be able to identify an illegal searched or seizure, have the evidence thrown out, and your case dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="dismissal"><a href="#motion_to_dismiss">Motion to Dismiss</a></h3>
<p>Cases can be dismissed because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cases are too old,</li>
<li>Your Speedy Trial rights were violated, or</li>
<li>The undisputed facts don't support a crime.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Trial">Trial</h2>
<p>When all other legal defenses have been exhausted and you are unwilling to accept anything less than a dismissal, it is often necessary to present your case to a jury to prove your innocence.</p>
<p>Importantly, I try cases regularly and have the experience to take your case to trial. Review my <a href="#about_results_trials">criminal jury verdicts</a> so that you can see the types of cases I have tried and the results I have obtained.</p>

<p>Many of my cases are resolved with charges being dropped or reduced, a minor fine, or a Not Guilty verdict.</p>

<p>All lawyers claim to be “aggressive,” I provide past results so you can make your own decision:</p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Probation in Florida</h1>
<p>The majority of criminal cases resolved by a plea in Florida result in the person being placed on supervised probation.</p>

<li><a href="#Conditions">Conditions of Probation</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="definition">Definition of Probation</h2>
<p>Probation is a form of supervision where a person (formerly called a “probationer”) reports to a Probation Officer on a regular basis.</p>
<p>While on probation, a probationer is required to comply with the conditions of probation, make payments towards any financial obligations imposed by the court (such as restitution, fines, and court costs), and pay a monthly fee for the cost of supervision.</p>
<p>Failure to report to report to your Probation Officer or comply with the conditions of probation results in a <a href="#violation_of_probation">Violation of Probation</a> proceeding being initiated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a probationer who reports as required and completes all conditions of probation early may petition the court <a href="#early_termination_of_probation">Early Termination of Probation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Types">Types of Probation</h2>
<p>In general, there are two types of supervised probation in Florida, either:</p>
<h3>County Probation</h3>
<p>All persons sentenced to probation by a County Court judge for a misdemeanor offense are placed on County Probation. In addition, offenders whose cases were formally charged as felonies, but then reduced to misdemeanors, are sometimes placed on County Probation at the judge’s discretion.</p>
<p>County Probation is supervised through the County in which you are sentenced and generally allows for more relaxed forms of supervision than State Probation; such as by telephone or mail.</p>
<h3>State Probation</h3>
<p>All persons sentenced to probation for felony offenses are placed on State Probation. In addition, offenders whose cases were formally charged as felonies, but who pled to misdemeanors, can also be placed on State Probation.</p>
<p>State Probation is supervised through the Florida Department of Corrections, Community Corrections division. It is generally considered to be more unforgiving and strict than County Probation.</p>
<h2 id="Conditions">Conditions of Probation</h2>
<p>All persons placed on probation in Florida, whether for a felony or a misdemeanor, are required to comply with any conditions of probation imposed by the court at sentencing.</p>
<h3>Standard Conditions</h3>
<p>The Standard Conditions of probation are imposed in every case where a person is placed on probation and are the minimum conditions of probation a person must comply with. [<a href="#FN1">1</a>]</p>
<ul>
<li>Listing of the <a href="#standard_conditions">Standard Conditions of Probation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Conditions</h3>
<p>Special Conditions of probation are imposed on a case-by-case basis, which are usually imposed because of unique circumstances surrounding the particular offense for which a person was placed on probation for.</p>
<p>Examples of special conditions of probation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anger Management</li>
<li>Community Service</li>
<li>Letters of Apology</li>
<li>No Contact Provisions</li>
<li>No Return Provisions</li>
<li>Substance Abuse Treatment</li>

<h1 itemprop="name">Florida’s Anti-Murder Act</h1>
<p>Florida’s Anti-Murder Act limits a judge’s ability to grant bond in felony violation of probation cases if the probationer is on probation for a <a href="#Sexually-Motivated-Offense">Sexually Motivated Offense</a> or qualifies as a <a href="#violent-felony-offender-of-special-concern">Violent Felony Offender of Special Concern</a>.
		
							<h2 id="Sexually-Motivated-Offense">Sexually Motivated Offenses</h2>
<p>Probationers who are on probation for a sexually motivated offense such as <a href="#sex_sexual_battery">Sexual Battery</a>, <a href="#sex_lewd_or_lascivious">Lewd and Lascivious Offenses</a>, or Sex Crimes Against Children are ineligible for bond prior to a violation of probation hearing unless the presiding judge conducts a “Danger Hearing” and determines the probationer is not a danger to the public.</p>
<h3>Danger Hearing</h3>
<p>The hearing held to determine whether a probationer poses a danger to the community is referred to as a Danger Hearing.</p>
<p>During the Danger Hearing, a judge can consider the following factors in determining whether the person can be granted bond:</p>
<ol>
<li>The nature and circumstances of the violation and any new offenses charged;</li>
<li>Past and present conduct, including convictions of crimes;</li>
<li>Any record of arrests without conviction for crimes involving violence or sexual crimes;</li>
<li>Any other evidence of allegations of unlawful sexual conduct or the use of violence by the offender or probationer;</li>
<li>Family ties, length of residence in the community, employment history, and mental condition;</li>
<li>History and conduct during the supervision from which the violation arose and other periods of supervision, including disciplinary records of previous incarcerations;</li>
<li>The likelihood of re-engaging in a criminal course of conduct;</li>
<li>The weight of the evidence supporting the probation violation; and </li>
<li>Any other facts the court considers relevant.</li>
</ol>
<p>Importantly, even if a judge determines that a probationer is not a danger to the community, the judge can still deny bail.</p>
<h2 id="violent-felony-offender-of-special-concern">Violent Felony Offender of Special Concern</h2>
<p>A Violent Felony Offender of Special Concern (VFOSC) is not allowed to be released on bond unless the alleged violation is solely for failure to pay court imposed financial obligations; otherwise the probationer must wait in jail until their violation of probation hearing and is not entitled to a bond under any circumstances.</p>
<h3>Definition of Violent Felony Offender of Special Concern</h3>
<p>A Violent Felony Offender of Special Concern is defined as any person who is on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Felony probation or community control related to the commission of a qualifying offense;</li>
<li>Felony probation or community control for any offense and has previously been convicted of a qualifying offense;</li>
<li>Felony probation or community control for any offense and is found to have violated by committing a qualifying offense;</li>
<li>Felony probation or community control and has previously been found by a court to be a <a href="#sentencing/enhancements.html#Habitual-Violent-Felony-Offender">habitual violent felony offender</a>;</li>
<li>Felony probation or community control and has previously been found by a court to be a three-time <a href="#sentencing/enhancements.html#Violent-Career-Criminal">violent felony offender</a>; or</li>
<li>Felony probation or community control and has previously been found by a court to be a sexual predator.</li>
</ol>

<h1 itemprop="name">Early Termination of Probation in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Early Termination of Probation is a discretionary act of the court.</blockquote>
<p>Florida law allows a person who is on probation for a criminal offense, to petition for early termination of their probation after completion of half of the court imposed probationary term.</p>
<h2>Eligibility for Early Termination</h2>
<p>To be eligible to petition for early termination of probation, the probationer must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed half of the court imposed probationary term.</li>
<li>Successfully completed any special conditions of probation imposed by the court; such as community service, substance abuse treatment, and self-improvement classes.</li>
<li>Paid off all court imposed restitution.</li>
<li>Paid off all court related financial obligations; such as fines, cost of investigation, costs of prosecution, public defender lien, and court costs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Discretionary Action</h3>
<p>The most important point to keep in mind is that early termination of probation is a discretionary act of the court; meaning the court does not have to grant early termination of probation just because you ask.</p>
<p>Usually, a court will be more willing to grant early termination of probation to first time offenders being supervised for non-violent offenses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a court is unlikely to grant early termination of probation to repeat offenders or probationers being supervised for violent offenses.</p>

<blockquote class="half">A violation of probation proceeding is much different than being charged with a new crime.</blockquote>
<p>A violation of probation proceeding is much different than being charged with a new crime. Because you have already been sentenced to probation, you have less protection than if you were charged with a new crime. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>No statute of limitations; Can't wait out the <acronym title="Violation of Probation">VOP</acronym>.</li>
<li>No right to a speedy violation of probation hearing. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></li>
<li>No constitutional right to request a bond while awaiting a <acronym title="Violation of Probation">VOP</acronym> hearing. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></li>
<li>No possibility of bond under Florida’s <a href="#anti_murder_act">Anti-Murder Act</a>.</li>
<li>No right to a jury trial in a <acronym title="Violation of Probation">VOP</acronym> hearing.</li>
<li>Hearsay is admissible in a <acronym title="Violation of Probation">VOP</acronym> hearing. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></li>
<li>You can be forced to testify against yourself.</li>
<li>Guilt is proven by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see it is much easier for the State to prove a probation violation than a new criminal charge.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are <a href="#defenses">defenses</a> to probation violations and we have successfully defended hundreds of clients accused of violating their probation.</p>
<h2>Probation Violations</h2>
<p>After you are placed on probation, you are advised of the conditions of your probation by the judge and your  probation officer. Should you disobey the conditions and violate your probation, you run the risk of having you probation violated.</p>
<p>There are two types of probation violations you can commit:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#technical-violation">Technical Violation</a></li>
<li><a href="#substantive-violation">Substantive Violation (New-Law Violation)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technical-violation">Technical Violations of Probation</h3>
<p>A technical violation is any violation of either your general or special conditions of probation.</p>
<p>Examples of technical violations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A positive drug or alcohol test result.</li>
<li>Failure to report to the probation office.</li>
<li>Failure to report a change in address or other required information.</li>
<li>Failure to attend a required class, treatment or counseling session, or meeting</li>
<li>Failure to submit to a drug or alcohol test.</li>
<li>A violation of curfew.</li>
<li>Failure to meet a monthly quota on any required probation condition, including, but not limited to, making restitution payments, paying court costs, or completing community service hours.</li>
<li>Leaving the county without permission.</li>
<li>Failure to report a change in employment.</li>
<li>Associating with a person engaged in criminal activity.
								</li></ul>
<h3 id="substantive-violation">Substantive Violations of Probation</h3>
<p>Substantive violations of probation occur when you commit a new criminal offense.</p>
<p>Importantly, an acquittal in a criminal case does not preclude the judge from determining that a probation violation occurred based on the same conduct. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small> Meaning, a prosecutor can still try to “prove-up” the offense at a subsequent VOP hearing. And, unlike in a criminal trial, the burden of proof is only a “preponderance of the evidence” and there is no right to a jury.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Violation of Probation Penalties</h2>
<p>If a probationer admits to violating probation or a judge finds a probationer in violation of probation after conducting a hearing, a judge is required to take one of three actions:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#revoke-probation">Revoke Probation</a></li>
<li><a href="#modify-probation">Modify Probation</a></li>
<li><a href="#continue-probation">Continue (Reinstate) Probation</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The only exception is if the probationer commits a first time low risk violation of probation and qualifies for a <a href="#low-risk-violation">mandatory modification or continuation of probation</a>, in which case the court can only modify or continue probation.</p>
<h3 id="revoke-probation">Revoke Probation</h3>
<p>Revocation of probation is the most common consequence of violating probation with a new criminal offense or when violating probation for a serious or violent felony offense.</p>
<p>If probation is revoked, the judge is required to <a href="#sentencing_judgment">adjudicate the probationer guilty</a> of the underlying offense and impose any sentence that could have been imposed when originally placing the probationer on probation or community control.</p>
<p>If the probationer does not score prison under Florida’s <a href="#sentencing_criminal_punishment_code">criminal punishment code</a>, the court may consider imposing a new term of probation or community control (without credit for supervision previously served) but more likely will sentence the probationer to a straight term of incarceration.</p>
<p>Importantly, if the probationer is found to be a danger to the community or qualifies as a <a href="anti-murder-act.html#violent-felony-offender-of-special-concern">Violent Felony Offender of Special Concern</a>, Florida law also allows a judge to impose an incarcerative sentence up to the maximum penalty available for the underlying criminal charge.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>A probationer is placed on two years of probation for <a href="#battery_felony_battery">Felony Battery</a> and violates probation by not completing an Anger Management Course. A judge could legally sentence the probationer up to five years in prison on the technical probation violation even if all other terms of probation were completed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="modify-probation">Modify Probation</h3>
<p>Modification of probation is the most common consequence for first time technical probation violators or for violating probation on an underlying non-violent offense. If probation is modified, the court can modify the terms of supervision by adding new conditions or extend the probationary period.</p>
<h4 id="low-risk-violation">First Time Low Risk Violation of Probation</h4>
<p>If a probationer commits a low-risk technical violation of probation and has not previously been found in violation of probation and does not qualify as a <a href="anti-murder-act.html#violent-felony-offender-of-special-concern">Violent Felony Offender of Special Concern</a>, the court must modify or continue probation. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<p>If the court elects to modify probation under this requirement, the court can impose up to 90 days in jail as a special condition of the modified probation.</p>
<h3 id="continue-probation">Continue Probation</h3>
<p>Continuation of probation is the most infrequently used method of resolving probation violations.</p>
<p>In those rare cases where a judge finds a person in violation of probation but decides against revoking or modifying the probationary term, the judge will admonish the probationer and simply continue (reinstate) them on probation with a warning against future violations.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Violation of Probation Defenses</h2>
<p>As a threshold matter, in order to support a finding that a probationer violated probation, the prosecutor must prove the alleged violation was both willful and substantial.</p>
<p>In addition to this general standard, defenses to violation of probation allegations include:</p>
<h3>Civil Traffic Infraction</h3>
<p>Probation may not be revoked based on a non-criminal traffic violation absent a special condition of probation preventing a person from driving. <small><a href="#references">[5]</a></small></p>
<h3>Constructive Possession</h3>
<p>A frequent basis to violate a probationer's probation is to allege that they were in possession of contraband, such as drugs or weapons.</p>
<p>However, if the contraband is not found on a person or in the person's exclusive possession, the State must prove that the probationer had knowledge of the
					presence of the contraband and the ability to exercise dominion and control over the same.  </p>
<p>Absent independent evidence supporting both elements of constructive possession, a judge is required to dismiss a violation of probation based solely on the constructive possession of contraband. <small><a href="#references">[6]</a></small></p>
<h3>Curfew Compliance</h3>
<p>Very frequently, probation officers will show up at a probationer's home in the middle of the night to conduct a curfew check and if the probationer does not answer the door, the probation officer will file a violation of probation.</p>
<p>When faced with an allegation a person violated a curfew imposed as a condition of probation, evidence that no one answered the door in response to a knock is legally insufficient to prove the curfew violation without other evidence showing the probationer was not at home sleeping. <small><a href="#references">[7]</a></small></p>
<h3>Inability to Pay</h3>
<p>Before a probationer can be violated for failure to pay a financial obligations, there must be an inquiry into whether the probationer had the ability to pay and willfully failed to do so. If the State does not prove the probationer had the ability to pay, then the violation of probation must be dismissed. <small><a href="#references">[8]</a></small></p>
<h3>Medical Emergency</h3>
<p>A violation of probation will not be upheld when factors beyond a probationer's control, such as a medical emergency, rather than a deliberate act of misconduct, result in the probationer's noncompliance with probation. <small><a href="#references">[9]</a></small></p>
<h3>Negligence or Ineptitude</h3>
<p>A probationer's good faith and reasonable attempts to follow probation instructions will not support a willful violation of probation if the alleged violation is the result of negligence or ineptitude. <small><a href="#references">[10]</a></small></p>
<p>However, a violation will be upheld if the careless or negligent conduct that led to the violation rises to the level of deliberateness or willful blindness.</p>
<h3>Sufficient Time Remaining</h3>
<p>Absent a judge imposing a beginning and ending date for completing a special condition, it is a defense to a probation violation that there is sufficient time remaining to complete the required special condition. <small><a href="#references">[11]</a></small></p>
<h3>Unaware of Special Condition</h3>
<p>When a person is placed on probation, they are presumed to have knowledge of any standard statutory conditions of probation conditions imposed.</p>
<p>However, it is a defense to a probation violation alleging if a probationer was never informed of, or instructed on, a special condition of probation at the time of sentencing by the judge or subsequently by their probation officer. <small><a href="#references">[12]</a></small></p>
<h3>Unilaterally Imposed Conditions</h3>
<p>Probation may only be revoked for violation of a condition which was imposed by the judge, not by a probation officer. <small><a href="#references">[13]</a></small> Consequently, a violation of probation can be dismissed if the violation is based on a probation officer's unilateral imposition of a probation condition that is not statutorily authorized, was not specifically imposed by the court, or is more onerous than the standard or special conditions originally imposed.</p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Alternatives to Entering a Plea</h1>
<p>If you are a <a href="#clients_first_time_offenders">first time offender</a>, or if you are charged with certain substance abuse offenses, you may be eligible to resolve your case in a manner that will not result in a formal conviction, or result in the charges being dropped all together.</p>
<p.below alternatives="" are="" available="" be="" may="" p="" that="" the="" to="" various="" you.<="">
<h2>Pretrial Diversion</h2>
<p>Pretrial Diversion (<abbr title="Pretrial Diversion">PTD</abbr>) is a diversionary program run by the State Attorney’s Office and is usually reserved for first time, nonviolent offenders.</p>
<p><abbr title="Pretrial Diversion">PTD</abbr> is similar to probation, in that once you are accepted into the program you must report monthly to a supervising officer, undergo random drug testing, complete community service hours, and refrain from being involved in any criminal activity.</p>
<p>Your charges will be dropped upon successful completion of Pretrial Diversion.</p>
<h2>Pretrial Intervention</h2>
<p>Pretrial Intervention is similar to Pretrial Diversion; however, it is run by the Court and is more lenient in that a person does not have to have a spotless record.</p>
<p>The Pretrial Intervention program is also similar to probation, in that once you are accepted into the program you must report to the Court on a regular basis, be evaluated for and undergo any recommended drug treatment, complete any other specific requirements ordered by the Court, and refrain from being involved in any criminal activity.</p>
<p>Importantly, many Judges do not participate in Pretrial Intervention. As a result it is important that you hire an attorney who is familiar with the different Judges and who can advise you accordingly.</p>
<p>Your charges will be dropped upon successful completion of Pretrial Intervention. </p>
<h2>Drug Court</h2>
<p>Drug Court is a diversionary program created to address the issue of felony drug offenders.</p>
<p>The program provides for the identification, evaluation, case management and placement of substance abusing offenders in order to avoid entering the formal criminal justice system.</p>
<p>The Drug Court Judge reviews progress reports on each participant. Incidents of noncompliance are reported immediately to the Drug Court Judge, along with recommendations as to consequences to be imposed.</p>
<p>Upon successful completion of Drug Court, your charges will be dropped.</p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Appeals</h1>
<p>If you are convicted after a trial or if you plead after losing a Motion to Dismiss or Motion to Suppress, you have 30 days after being sentenced to appeal .</p>
<p>Generally, there is no right to an appeal from a plea of guilty or nolo contendere if the sentence you received was a legal one. An appeal will only help you if the judge did not follow the law, or if you were prevented from properly exercising all your rights.</p>
<h2>Supercedes Bond</h2>
<p>If your case is appealed, the judge may allow your release on bail until a final decision appellate is reached; this is known as a supercedes bond. </p>
<p>The judge will only do this if he or she believes you have a good reason for appealing and believes you will re-appear in court; however, you do not have an automatic right to bail when appealing.</p>
<p>If you wish to appeal your case, you should discuss this matter with your attorney as soon as possible. In no event should you wait more than 30 days before contacting your attorney. </p>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" -->
<h1 itemprop="name">Arraignment</h1>
<p>An arraignment is a proceeding where a person enters a plea of Guilty or Not Guilty to criminal charges.</p>
<p>An arraignment is primarily a ministerial event and is not a time where evidence is presented or the merits of the State’s case are debated.</p>
<h2>Waiving Arraignment</h2>
<p>While all unrepresented defendant’s must appear for their arraignment, the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure allow an attorney to waive their client’s arraignment by filing a Written Plea of Not Guilty prior to the arraignment date.</p>
<p>Once a Written Plea of Not Guilty is filed, neither the attorney nor the defendant are required to appear for the arraignment. I would estimate that 99‰ of attorneys file Written Pleas of Not Guilty and waive their client’s arraignment.</p>
<p>If a defendant has not retained an attorney by their arraignment date, they must personally appear, and should advise the court they are looking for an attorney, and ask that a plea of not guilty be entered.</p>
<p>Most judges will then set the case of a Determination of Counsel hearing, which is a subsequent hearing intended to allow a defendant enough time to obtain an attorney.</p>

<div itemprop="mainEntity" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
<p><a name="1"><span itemprop="name">What is an arrest?</span></a></p>
<p itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><span itemprop="text">When you are arrested, you are taken into custody. This means that you are not free to leave the scene. Without being arrested, however, you still could be detained or held for questioning for a short time if a police officer or other person believes you may be involved in a crime. For example, an officer may detain you if you are carrying a large box near a recent burglary site. Storekeepers also can detain you if they suspect you have stolen something.</span></p>
<p>Whether you are arrested or detained, you do not have to answer any questions except to give your name and address and show some identification if requested.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p><strong><a name="2">2. What rights do I have?</a></strong></p>
<p>Whether you are an adult citizen or non-citizen, you have certain rights if you are arrested. Before the law enforcement officer questions you, he or she should tell you that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to remain silent. </li>
<li>Anything you say may be used against you. </li>
<li>You have a right to have a lawyer present while you are questioned.</li>
<li>If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you. </li>
</ul>
<p>These are your Miranda rights, guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. If you are not given these warnings, your lawyer can ask that any statements you made to the police not be used against you in court. But this does not necessarily mean that your case will be dismissed. And this does not apply if you volunteer information without being questioned by the police.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p><strong><a name="3">3. Once I'm told my rights, can I be questioned?</a></strong></p>
<p>You can be questioned, without a lawyer present, only if you voluntarily give up your rights and if you understand what you are giving up. If you agree to the questioning, then change your mind, the questioning must stop as soon as you say so or as soon as you say that you want a lawyer. If the questioning continues after you request a lawyer and you continue to talk, your answers can be used against you if you testify to something different.</p>
<p>You may be required to give certain physical evidence. For example, if you are suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol, you may be requested to take a test to measure the amount of alcohol in your system. If you refuse to take the test, your driver’s license can be suspended and the refusal can also be used against you in court.</p>
<p>Once you have been booked, (meaning your arrest has been written into official police records, and you have been fingerprinted and photographed) you have a right to make and complete three free telephone calls within the local dialing area. Any additional calls made from jail must be collect calls.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p><strong><a name="4">4. When should I see a lawyer?</a></strong></p>
<p>If you are arrested for a crime, particularly a serious one, <a href="##contact/">you should contact me as soon as possible</a>. I can advise you or your family or friends on the bail process and what steps to take next.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p><strong><a name="5">5. What if I can't afford a lawyer?</a></strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution guarantees everyone charged with a crime the right to legal counsel. A public defender, or other court-appointed attorney, will be appointed for you if you cannot afford to hire an attorney on your own.</p>
<p>Public defenders are experienced trial attorneys licensed by the Florida Bar who specialize in criminal law. They do not work for the prosecutors or the police; they are there to represent your best interests.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p><strong><a name="6">6. Who can arrest me?</a></strong></p>
<p>All law enforcement officers (such as police officers, county sheriff officers, investigators in a State Attorney’s Office or the Attorney General’s Office, and highway patrol officers) can arrest you whether they are on or off duty, in most cases. A probation or parole officer also can arrest you.</p>
<p>They can arrest you even if they do not have an arrest warrant - if they have probable cause or good reason to believe you committed a felony. A felony is a crime of a more serious nature than a misdemeanor, usually punishable by imprisonment for more than a year. A misdemeanor is usually punishable with a fine or a jail term of less than one year. They do not have to see you commit a felony in order to arrest you. They do, however, have to see you commit a misdemeanor in order to arrest you.</p>
<p>If you commit an infraction, they may ask you to sign a citation or notice instead of taking you into custody. This is a minor offense, such as a moving violation, where the punishment usually is a fine. If you sign the citation, you are not admitting guilt; you are only promising to appear in court. If you have no identification or refuse to sign, however, an officer may take you into custody.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p><strong><a name="7">7. When is an arrest warrant used?</a></strong></p>
<p>Usually, a warrant is required before you can be taken into custody from within your home. But you can be arrested at home without a warrant if fast action is needed to prevent you from escaping, destroying evidence, endangering someone’s life or seriously damaging property.</p>
<p>An arrest warrant must be signed by a magistrate or judge, who must have good reason to believe that you committed a crime.</p>
<p>Once an arrest warrant is issued, any law enforcement officer in the state can arrest you - even if the officer does not have a copy of the warrant. Generally, there is no time limit on using a warrant to make an arrest.</p>
<p>Before entering your home, a law enforcement officer must knock, identify him or herself and tell you that you're going to be arrested. If you refuse to open the door - or if there’s another good reason - the officer can break in through a door or window.</p>
<p>If the police have an arrest warrant, you should be allowed to see it. If they don't have the warrant with them, you should be allowed to see it as soon as is practical.</p>
<p>The police may search the area within your reach. If you are arrested outdoors, they may not search your home or car.</p>
<p>Resisting an arrest or detention is a crime. If you resist arrest, you can be charged with a misdemeanor or felony in addition to the crime for which you are being arrested. If you resist, an officer can use force to overcome your resistance or prevent your escape. The officer can even use deadly force if it appears you will use force to cause great bodily injury.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p><strong><a name="8">8. What is bail and how is it set?</a></strong></p>
<p>The amount of bail - money or other security deposited with the court to insure that you will appear - is set by a schedule in each county. For some traffic citations, you may be notified that you can forfeit or give up bail instead of appearing in court. However, if you have any doubt, go to court so a new warrant is not issued for your arrest for failing to appear.</p>
<p>When you are taken to court for bail setting or release, the judge will consider the seriousness of the offense with which you are charged, any prior failures to appear (even for traffic tickets), any previous criminal record and your connections to the community, as well as the probability that you'll appear in court. Generally, the amount of bail is set according to a written schedule based on your charges.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p><strong><a name="9">9. Who maintains arrest records and what do they include?</a></strong></p>
<p>Local police departments, sheriff’s offices and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement keep arrest records. They share their records through a criminal database known as the Criminal Justice Information System (“CJIS”).</p>
<p>The arrest record includes when and why you were arrested, whether the charges against you were dropped or whether you were convicted of the charges and the subsequent sentence imposed. Both pleading guilty and being found guilty after a trial count as convictions.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p><strong><a name="10">10. What happens at an Initial Appearance?</a></strong></p>
<p>You have a right to an Initial Appearance without unnecessary delay after being arrested, usually within 48 hours. At the Initial Appearance, you will appear before a judge who will officially inform you of the accusations against you.</p>
<p>An attorney may be appointed for you if you can't afford one, and the bail can be raised or lowered depending on the circumstances of the case. You also can ask to be released on R.O.R., even if bail was previously set.</p>
<p>If you are charged with a crime and are unable to understand English, you have a right to an interpreter throughout the proceedings.</p>
<p>If you are charged with a misdemeanor, you can plead guilty or not guilty at the Initial Appearance. Or, if the court approves, you can plead nolo contendere, meaning that you will not contest the charges. Legally, this is the same as a guilty plea, but it cannot be used against you in a non-criminal case.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p><strong><a name="11">11. When can an officer conduct a search?</a></strong></p>
<p>An officer can always conduct a search with either your consent or a search warrant. You have a right, however, to see the warrant before the search begins.</p>
<div class="faq-return"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></div>
<p><strong><a name="12">12. When can an officer search you, your home or your car without a warrant?</a></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Body Searches</strong>: If you are arrested, an officer can search you, without a warrant, for weapons, evidence or illegal or stolen goods. Strip searches should not be conducted for offenses that do not involve weapons, drugs or violence unless police reasonably suspect you are concealing a weapon or illegal goods, and they have authorization from the supervising officer on duty. If you are booked and jailed, you may undergo a full body search, including body cavities.</li>
<li><strong>Home Searches</strong>: In emergencies, such as when an officer may be trying to prevent someone from destroying evidence, your home can be searched without your consent and without a warrant.<br/>
					
					If you are taken into custody in your home, an officer can only search the limited area in which you were arrested. Other rooms - and even other parts of the same room - are off limits, unless the officer has a search warrant or believes that other suspects are hiding in other rooms. While searching your home, an officer can seize evidence of any crime, such as stolen property or drugs, which is in plain sight.</li>
<li><strong>Car Searches</strong>: Your car and trunk can be searched without your consent or a warrant if an officer has good reason to believe it contains illegal or stolen goods or evidence. If the police stop your car for any legal reason - such as a broken taillight - they can take any illegal goods in plain sight.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you, your home or your car is searched illegally, a judge might say that any evidence found during the search cannot be used against you in court. If you or your lawyer, however, does not object to the evidence before trial, the court might allow the evidence to be used. Even if the judge does decide that the evidence cannot be used against you, your case will not necessarily be dismissed.</p>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" -->
<h1 itemprop="name">First Appearance</h1>
<p>After a person is arrested, they will appear before a judge within 48 hours of their arrest. This appearance is known as a First Appearance.</p>
<p>At a First Appearance, a judge advises a defendant of the charges against them and conducts a probable cause determination.</p>
<h2>Probable Cause Determination</h2>
<p>A probable cause determination is a review of the police report (arrest affidavit) to determine whether the facts alleged by law enforcement would support a conviction for the crime on which a defendant was arrested or for some lesser crime.</p>
<p>If a judge determines there is probable cause, the judge will then inquire as to whether a defendant intends to hire a private attorney or wishes to have a public defender appointed, and then determine bond conditions.</p>
<h3>No Probable Cause</h3>
<p>If a judge determines there is no probable cause, the judge will release the person on their own recognizance (ROR) on the charge where no probable cause was found.</p>
<p>When a judge finds no probable cause (no-PC), a judge is not dismissing the case. Rather, the judge is only saying that there is insufficient evidence to support requiring an appearance bond.</p>
<p>Even though no-PC was found, the prosecutor can still prosecute the case based upon the evidence they have or they can obtain additional evidence before filing <a href="#formal_charges">formal charges</a>.</p>
<h2>Bond Determination</h2>
<p>Once a judge has found probable cause and addressed representation, the judge will then decide if a <a href="bond/">bond</a> is appropriate, and if so, how much to set the bond at.</p>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" -->
<h1 itemprop="name">Filing Formal Charges</h1>
<h2>The Charging Decision</h2>
<p>Just because you have been arrested does not mean that you will actually be charged with a crime. After being arrested, the State Attorney reviews the Law Enforcement investigation packet, charging affidavit, and any other evidence they are provided, before making a final decision.</p>
<p>This is a crucial time, because a lawyer can intervene with the State Attorney’s Office, provide them with supplemental evidence or mitigation and either persuade them that not to file formal charges, or to file lesser charge that are more appropriate for the conduct alleged.</p>
<p>The worst thing that could happen would be if the State Attorney’s Office filed the most severe charges possible for your facts, which puts us at a disadvantage in future negotiations.</p>
<h2>Time Limitations</h2>
<p>There are certain time limitations that a State Attorney must satisfy in order to lawfully prosecute a defendant. These limitations are the:</p>
<ol>
<li>33 Day Motion (ROR Rule);</li>
<li><a href="#speedy_trial">Speedy Trial Rule</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="#statute_of_limitations">Statute of Limitations</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Victim Cannot Drop Charges</h2>
<p>It is important to note that the State Attorney’s office has the sole discretion to decide whether to file formal charges against you. Even if witnesses do not want to testify against you or they want to stop the case, the State Attorney may still press forward on the charges. </p>
<p>Florida law gives the State Attorney this type of discretion and they can subpoena witnesses to come to court and force them to testify.

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" -->
<h1 itemprop="name">Pleas</h1>
<p>While the law presumes you are innocent until proven guilty, if charged with a crime, you will be required to plead one of three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not Guilty</li>
<li>Nolo Contendere (Latin for No Contest)</li>
<li>Guilty</li>
</ol>
<p>A “Not Guilty” plea is entered when you are innocent, when you are not certain which plea to enter, when there is not enough evidence against you to prove guilt, or when you want to demand a public trial. </p>
<p>If you plead guilty or nolo contendere, either to the charges against you or to some lesser charge, the judge will ask you questions so that  the judge can confirm that you know what you are accused of, that you understand the penalties, and that no one is forcing you to enter the plea. The judge will then proceed with sentencing.</p>
<p>The majority of the time, a plea is entered pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement. However, even if the State Attorney and I have a negotiated plea agreement in place, the judge is not required to accept the agreement. In which case we will have to make a decision to renegotiate an agreement acceptable to the judge, proceed to trial, or plea as charged. Nevertheless, the majority of judges will accept and honor negotiated plea agreements.</p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Preparing Your Defense</h1>
<p>Once retained, I will meet with you to go over the facts of your case, speak with your witnesses, obtain a copy of the charging document, and engage in the discovery process. Each case is different and complicated cases naturally take longer than other cases. </p>
<p>I will file the necessary discovery motions to obtain State witness lists, police reports, witnesses' statements, reports of experts and all other important facts in your case. Discovery depositions and other statements given under oath may be taken from witnesses. I will also likely approach the prosecutor to get an idea of the prosecutors' attitude about your case. </p>
<p>The prosecutor may decide to dismiss all charges or to “plea bargain,” which is to agree to a lighter sentence or drop some of several charges against you, in exchange for a plea of guilty or nolo contendere (no contest). If the prosecutor offers a plea bargain to you, I will inform you of it immediately, as I have an ethical duty to inform you of any plea offers, even if you have said you wanted a trial regardless of the plea offer. </p>
<h3>Investigating your Case</h3>
<p>Anything you say to me is confidential. Conversations with other people are not confidential. These people include your spouse, family, friends, CELLMATES, news reporters, probation officers, or police officers. You should not talk to these people about your case. If you are asked about your case, you direct that person to speak with your attorney regarding any matters concerning your case.</p>
<p>It is important you cooperate with my investigator and me. I must know the truth even if the truth makes you look guilty, makes you think you are guilty, or if in fact you are guilty. If the truth is known, I will not be caught off guard and will be able to better represent you. This is because it is the State of Florida’s job to prove your guilt. Many cases are not about guilt or innocence, it is about whether the State of Florida can prove their case, whether they followed the law in arresting you, whether they violated your civil rights, and whether they can locate the necessary witnesses to testify against you. Even if you are guilty of a crime, the State Attorney’s office inability to satisfy all of these needs may force them to drop the case against you.</p>
<p>You can help the investigation of your case by providing the names and addresses of witnesses. If you are out of jail, you can help your case by finding witnesses and notifying me by sending a letter, calling in, or coming to the office with the names and addresses of those witnesses. If you are in jail, try to have your family and friends find witnesses. A witness may be anyone who can testify to any circumstances which may show you are not guilty or which may tend to show that the crime was not as serious as the prosecutor claims. My investigator may interview the witnesses against you and try to locate defense witnesses. Accurate names and addresses are helpful. </p>
<p>You should not, however, contact witnesses for the prosecution, the victim, or send other people to talk to the witnesses or the victim for you. If you do, you may be charged with a new crime of tampering with witnesses. </p>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" -->
<h1 itemprop="name">Florida Trial Procedure</h1>
<p>If you enter a plea of not guilty, you will have a trial unless the charges are dismissed or you change your plea prior to trial.</p>
<p>In Florida, there are two types of trials that can be held:</p>
<ol>
<li>Non-Jury Trial (Bench Trial); or</li>
<li>Jury Trial</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Non-Jury">Non-Jury Trial</h2>
<p>In a non-jury trial, only the judge decides whether a crime has been committed, and whether you are criminally responsible for that crime; in a non-jury trial there is no jury. A jury is used for most trials. </p>
<p>A non-jury trial can only be conducted with the agreement of the prosecutor, the defendant, and the judge.</p>
<p>Generally, non-jury trials are only conducted for relatively minor cases, where none of the parties want to go through the time consuming process of picking a jury, or for cases where the primary issue to be decided is a legal argument.</p>
<h2 id="Jury">Jury Trial</h2>
<p>In a jury trial, a judge presides over the courtroom proceedings, and six or more citizens from the community are chosen as jurors to hear the evidence presented against you.</p>
<p>These jurors determine whether a crime has been committed and whether you are criminally responsible for that crime. </p>
<h3>Jury Selection (Voir Dire)</h3>
<p>This is the process by which the jury is selected.</p>
<p>In jury selection, a panel of between twenty to thirty people is questioned, from which six people will be selected to sit as jurors in your trial.</p>
<p>Each side is allowed to fully question the jury panel to determine bias or prejudice. The state questions the panel first and the defense follows.</p>
<p>Once questioning is complete, both sides are allowed three peremptory strikes in a misdemeanor trial, six peremptory strikes in a felony trial. Peremptory strikes allow a person to be stricken from the jury panel for any reason.
				
				<p>Additionally, a juror may be struck for cause if they indicate that they have a fixed opinion that will not allow them to follow the law. This could be anything from saying that they would require the defendant to testify, to saying they don't believe in innocent until proven guilty.</p>
<p>A juror that the court excuses for cause is not counted against the peremptory strikes that each side is allowed.</p>
<h3>Sequestration of the Witnesses</h3>
<p>This is a rule of procedure invoked after jury selection is completed. All witnesses are brought forward to the court, and instructed that they must stay outside of the courtroom until called and are not to discuss the case with any other witness.</p>
<h2>Opening Statements</h2>
<p>This is where the parties advise the jury what they believe the evidence will show.</p>
<p>The opening statement is not supposed to an argument, but rather an uninterrupted story of what the trial will show, through the evidence and testimony. Since the State has the burden of proving the charges, they address the jury first, and the defense follows.</p>
<p>An opening statement can be anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour.</p>
<h3>Presentation of the Evidence</h3>
<p>At the conclusion of opening statements, the State presents its case first, primarily through the calling of witnesses to testify. The State may call its witnesses in any order they determine. They may call all or just some of the people they have listed on the witness list. </p>
<p>At the conclusion of the State’s direct examination, the defense attorney cross-examines the state witnesses.</p>
<p>Cross-examination is a defense attorney’s opportunity to bring out all counterpoints were omitted by the state; such as bias, mistake, lack of knowledge, etc.</p>
<p>Depending on the testimony the witness has given, the Defense may ask many questions, or in some cases, no questions. Again, determining what to ask on cross-examination is a strategic decision that is planned long in advance.</p>
<h3>Objections</h3>
<p>During the presentation of evidence, attorneys may object for a variety of legal reasons, which must be stated at the time the objection is made.</p>
<p>Many times the Court will ask the lawyers to approach on a particular objection in order to make legal argument outside of the jury’s presence. If there is lengthy legal argument to be made, the court may ask the courtroom deputies to remove the jury from the courtroom, to allow the lawyers to speak more freely so the jury does not hear the legal argument and draw improper conclusions.</p>
<h3>A Defendant’s Role During Trial</h3>
<p>The Defendant is a valuable resource during the trial, but may not completely understand the technical legal aspects of the case.</p>
<p>A Defendant should listen carefully to all testimony, and be ready to point out inconsistencies or misstatements to the attorney.</p>
<p>Importantly, what a Defendant believes to be important, may not be shared by the defense attorney. It is for this reason that the defense attorney has the final say regarding information that is put before the jury in both cross-examination and through defense witnesses.</p>
<p>So every inconsistency, omission, etc., that the client points out will not necessarily be focused on.</p>
<h3>Close of the State’s Case</h3>
<p>Once the State has called all the witnesses it believes necessary to prove the legal elements of the crimes charged, they will rest their case. At this time, a recess is taken, and the Court allows the Defense to make a Motion for Judgment of Acquittal (JOA). A JOA asks the Court to find that the State has failed to make a sufficient showing to allow the specific charge to go to the jury. This motion is rarely granted, so the making of it is largely a formality, but it’s like the lottery, you can't win if you don't play.</p>
<h3>The Defense’s Case</h3>
<p>The defense is not required to call witnesses, and the Court tells the jury this at several points in the trial.</p>
<p>Many times the defense theory is sufficiently brought out through cross-examination, so there is no need to call witnesses.</p>
<p>However, if defense witnesses are called, the same rules that applied to the State’s witness apply to defense witnesses.</p>
<p>A defense attorney may call all or just some defense witnesses, depending on how the testimony is coming out.</p>
<p>The goal is to tell the Defendant’s story in a coherent, interesting, streamlined, and credible manner, all the while minimizing the potential for conflict between defense witnesses.</p>
<p>You have the absolute right to testify or remain silent and the Court will instruct the jury of this several times during the course of the case. The decision as to how to best defend your case is complex and should be discussed in detail prior to trial. Nevertheless, it is often a strategic decision that is made by the lawyer and client, as the trial unfolds. Some judges find a moment when the jury is out of the room, when it becomes appropriate, and ask the Client on the record what your decision is, and whether you agree with it. Generally, we do not have to make a decision until the close of the State’s case.</p>
<h2>State’s Rebuttal</h2>
<p>Once the Defendant has rested, the State is permitted to put on witnesses to rebut a specific point about which the Defendant’s witness has testified. The same rules apply to them as all other witnesses. These witnesses must be on the witness list, so there are no surprises.</p>
<h2>Defendant’s Surrebuttal</h2>
<p>On rare occasions, the Defendant may put on rebuttal witnesses to rebut the rebuttal. </p>
<h2>Closing Argument</h2>
<p>After all the evidence is presented, each side makes its closing arguments to the jury. Each side is allowed equal time for closing argument. Closing argument should pull all the evidence and testimony together, and explain to the jury why the charges are proved or not proved.</p>
<p>We can use any evidence or exhibits that were used in the course of the trial, as well as special exhibits designed to highlight our key points. This can take as long as an hour, or as little as 15 minutes in short cases. Again, the Court will allow us as much time as we need, but we must be factual, to the point, and persuasive. </p>
<h2>The Jury’s Role</h2>
<p>At the conclusion of closing arguments, the judge then tells the jury the laws and rules to be applied during the jury’s deliberation.</p>
<p>The jury then deliberates in a jury room until they reach a unanimous verdict of either guilty or not guilty. Depending on the severity of the charges you face, a jury can also find a defendant guilty of a lesser crime.</p>
<p>If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict, then a mistrial is announced and the case will be reset for a new trial at a later date.</p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Bond Hearings in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">The law requires judges to set bond hearings quickly and impose reasonable conditions of release.</blockquote>
<p>If your friend or loved one has been arrested and cannot bond out of jail, I can help you obtain a bond. To assist you in understanding the bond process, you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Bond">What exactly is “Bond”</a></li>
<li><a href="#Basic-Principles">The Basic Principles of Bond</a></li>
<li><a href="#Bond-Hearing">How a Bond Hearing is Scheduled</a></li>
<li><a href="#Reasonable-Bond">How a Reasonable Bond is Determined</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, the law requires judges to set bond hearings quickly and impose reasonable conditions of release. </p>
<p>Hire me and I will move quickly to schedule a bond hearing and ask for a lower bond or more convenient conditions of release.</p>
<h2 id="Bond">What is Bond?</h2>
<p>In Florida, the legal term Pretrial Release is synonymous with the words bail and bond. </p>
<p>Technically though, bail or bond is just the monetary amount that must be posted before a person can be released from jail pending trial. </p>
<p>However, even if you post the monetary amount (bond) you may also have to agree to other conditions before the jail will actually release you. Collectively, these conditions (including the bond amount) are known as Pretrial Release.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>You are arrested for Domestic Violence Battery. A judge would normally set bond at $1,000, but also order that you be outfitted with and wear a GPS ankle monitor, have no contact with the “victim,” not drink alcohol, and not return to the common residence.</p>
<p>So the judge granted you Pretrial Release, but only if you comply with the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post a $1,000 bond,</li>
<li>Wear a GPS ankle monitor,</li>
<li>Not contact the victim,</li>
<li>Not drink alcohol, and</li>
<li>Not return to your home.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Basic-Principles">The Basic Principles of Bond</h2>
<p>You have a right to bail, unless you are charged with a capital crime (i.e. carries a penalty life imprisonment or death) or you are facing a violation of probation. </p>
<p>In Florida, non-monetary conditions of release are supposed to be imposed if possible, but judges almost always require that a monetary bond be posted. In setting the bail amount, the judge must be convinced that you will appear in court when required and generally makes this determination by weighing your ties to the community versus the likelihood you would flee if released. </p>
<p>If the court finds your charge is not a serious crime, or that you will appear in court when required, or that you have a responsible person in the community who will guarantee your appearance in court, the judge has the option of releasing you without bail. This is called release on your own recognizance (ROR). </p>
<p>If the Judge imposes bail in an amount you cannot afford, I can file a motion to reduce your bail. However, you do not have a right to multiple bond hearings unless there are significant changes in circumstances, so it is important that we provide a strong showing of your ties to the community and your willingness to appear at all scheduled court dates during the first bond hearing.</p>
<h2 id="Bond-Hearing">How a Bond Hearing is Scheduled</h2>
<p>At a bond hearing a judge will determine whether the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bond should be lowered, or</li>
<li>Conditions of release should be modified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scheduling a bond hearing is no simple task. First a Motion to Set Bond must be prepared and filed with the Clerk of the Court. Then the bond motion must be scheduled in front of the correct judge. And determining the correct judge can be difficult depending on whether charges have formally been filed, whether the case is a misdemeanor, felony, or violation of probation charge.</p>
<p>Finally, once the correct judge has been identified, it is necessary to coordinate hearing time with the clerk of the court, the judge, the judge’s assistant, and the prosecutor.</p>
<h2 id="Reasonable-Bond">How a Reasonable Bond is Determined</h2>
<p>Once a bond hearing is scheduled, the judge will consider how long you have lived in the area, whether you have family in the area, whether you are working, whether you have been allowed out on bail before and appeared in court when required, and whether you have a criminal record.</p>
<p>Additionally, the court can consider any of the following information in determining reasonable conditions of release:</p>
<ul>
<li>The nature of the crimes,</li>
<li>The amount of evidence,</li>
<li>Community ties, including:
							<ul>
<li>Local Family Members,</li>
<li>Length of Residence,</li>
<li>Employment History,</li>
<li>Financial Resources, and</li>
<li>Mental Condition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Past and Present Criminal History, including:
							<ul>
<li>Any Criminal Convictions,</li>
<li>Past Failures to Appear, and</li>
<li>Previous Flight from Prosecution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Source of Funds to post Bail,</li>
<li>Whether a Danger to the Community or victim exists, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Arrest Warrants in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">An Arrest Warrant is also known as a Capias in Florida.</blockquote>
<p>An Arrest Warrant is a court order to arrest a person and take them into custody.</p>
<p>An Arrest Warrant can be issued for a variety of reasons, the most common types of warrants are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#extradition">Extradition Warrants</a></li>
<li>Failure to Appear Warrants</li>
<li><a href="#felony">Felony Arrest Warrants</a></li>
<li><a href="#probation_violation_of_probation">Violation of Probation Warrants</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, while the terms Arrest Warrant and Capias are often used interchangeably, they actually have slightly different meanings.</p>
<p>An Arrest Warrant is a court order to take a person into custody that is issued prior to formal charges being filed against the person. A Capias is a court order to take a person into custody that is issued after formal charges have been filed against the person. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h2>No-Bond and Bondable Warrants</h2>
<p>When a judge issues an arrest warrant, the judge can either set a bond or order that the person be held on “No-Bond.”</p>
<p>If a bond is set, the person can bond out of jail immediately after being arrested by posting the bond amount and agreeing to appear at the next scheduled court date in the county where the arrest warrant was issued.</p>
<p>If the judge sets “No-Bond” (which is sometimes designated as NONE on an arrest warrant), the person cannot bond out of jail immediately after being arrested and must wait until they appear before the judge who issued the arrest warrant.</p>
<p>As a result, the person will either have to wait in jail until the next court date or schedule a <a href="#bond/">Bond Hearing</a> to try and persuade the judge to set a bond.</p>
<h2>Determining if Warrant is Active</h2>
<p>Determining whether you have an active warrant depends on whether the warrant was issued for suspicion of a new criminal offense or for a criminal case you have previously been arrested on.</p>
<h3>Arrest Warrants for New Crimes</h3>
<p>If the arrest warrant is for a new felony offense, the court case, and thus the arrest warrant, remains sealed until the person is arrested or one year has passed since the arrest warrant or capias was issued. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>The reason court files are initially sealed is to prevent potential suspects from evading arrest should they become aware that an arrest warrant has been issued against them.</p>
<h3>Arrest Warrant for Failure to Appear, Probation Violations</h3>
<p>Unlike arrest warrants for new offenses, a person knows if they failed to appear for court or violated probation. As a result the court records for these cases are not sealed and a person can contact the Clerk of the Court to determine the status of the arrest warrant.</p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Extradition in Florida</h1>
<blockquote class="half">The likelihood of successfully challenging extradition is very small.</blockquote>
<p>If you or a loved one have an outstanding Extradition Warrant, you need to know the:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Definition">Definition of Extradition</a></li>
<li><a href="#Proceedings">Florida Extradition Proceedings</a></li>
<li><a href="#Defenses">Florida Extradition Defenses</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="definition">Definition of Extradition</h2>
<p>Extradition is the formal process by which a fugitive arrested in one state (the asylum state) on an extradition warrant is surrendered to another state (the demanding state) for trial or punishment.</p>
<h3>Extradition Warrant</h3>
<p>An Extradition Warrant is an <a href="#index">Arrest Warrant</a> issued by another state, requesting that a fugitive be arrested and transported back to the demanding state.</p>
<p>The primary reason an attorney is needed in interstate extradition cases is that even if the demanding state has authorized the person to post a bond, the bond cannot be posted in the asylum state, only in the demanding state.</p>
<p>As a result, the person must remain incarcerated until the demanding state retrieves the fugitive; a process that often takes thirty (30) days or more.</p>
<p>However, this situation can sometimes be avoided by convincing a judge in the asylum state to set what is known as an <a href="#Extradition-Bond">Extradition Bond.</a></p>
<h2 id="Proceedings">Florida Extradition Proceedings</h2>
<p>Once a person is arrested on an out-of-state warrant, referred to as a fugitive warrant, the person has three options. They can either:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#Consent">Consent to Extradition</a></li>
<li><a href="#Extradition-Bond">Request an Extradition Bond</a></li>
<li><a href="#Extradition-Hearing">Request an Extradition Hearing</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Consent">Consent to Extradition</h3>
<p>Formally referred to as a Written Waiver of Extradition Proceedings, consent to extradition occurs in the vast majority of extradition cases.</p>
<p>This is because the likelihood of successfully challenging extradition is very small and by the time an extradition hearing is even heard, they would have already been transported back to the demanding state - where they could then bond out.</p>
<h3 id="Extradition-Bond">Request an Extradition Bond</h3>
<p>As mentioned, the only way to avoid incarceration pending extradition is to convince a judge in the asylum state to set what is known as an Extradition Bond.</p>
<p>An Extradition Bond allows a person to post a bail-bond conditioned on an agreement that the person will appear at any future court proceedings in Florida regarding the extradition request. <small><a href="#FN1">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>Though not always the case, extradition bonds are usually sought by people who acknowledge the validity of the fugitive warrant but are willing to voluntarily travel to the demanding state to surrender, bond out on the charges in the demanding state, and then return to Florida to provide proof of the surrender. Once the proof of surrender is provided, the extradition bond in Florida is released.</p>
<h3 id="Extradition-Hearing">Request an Extradition Hearing</h3>
<p>Before a person will be extradited, the following procedural safeguards must be met to insure that a lawful arrest warrant was issued and that the person arrested is actually the person wanted.</p>
<ol>
<li>An arrest warrant issued by another state (the demanding state).</li>
<li>The demanding state produces a sworn charging document alleging a criminal offense.
					  <ul>
<li>The document must be certified as authentic by the demanding state.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The sworn documents provide sufficient information identifying the arrested person as the actual fugitive.</li>
<li>The demanding state must retrieve the fugitive within thirty days from time of arrest or the fugitive will be released.
					<ul>
<li>Some states allow up to 90 days before they will release a fugitive.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="defenses">Florida Extradition Defenses</h2>
<p>As a result of the above procedural safeguards, the primary defenses available to contest interstate extradition are the defenses of:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#Dual-Criminality">Dual Criminality</a></li>
<li>Insufficient Documentation</li>
<li>Insufficient Identification</li>
</ol>
<p>If these defenses are sufficiently raised, the asylum state judge will either release the person, with or without bond, or continue the extradition hearing thirty additionally days or more to allow the demanding state time to correct the deficient information.</p>
<h3 id="Dual-Criminality">Dual Criminality</h3>
<p>Dual criminality (also known as Double Criminality) is a requirement that a fugitive can only be extradited from an asylum state to a demanding state, if the asylum state criminalizes the same type of conduct that forms the basis of the demanding state’s extradition warrant.</p>
<p>As a result, an extradition warrant can be challenged if it is based on conduct that the asylum state does not consider to be a criminal offense.</p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Expungement of Criminal Records in Florida</h1>
<img alt="Criminal Record Expungement" class="bc" src="##Library/images/stock/criminal-record-expungement.png" width="300px"/>
<p>Expungement occurs when a court orders law enforcement to physically destroy the criminal records related to an arrest and to remove the arrest history from public view.</p>
<p>Once expunged, the criminal records will no longer appear on a background check and a person can lawfully deny they were ever arrested or charged.</p>
<h2>Expungement Options</h2>
<p>There are several expungement options available under Florida law.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#administrative-expungement">Administrative Expugement</a></li>
<li><a href="#court-ordered-expungement">Court-ordered Expungement</a></li>
<li><a href="#human-trafficking-victim-expungement">Human Trafficking Victim Expungement</a></li>
<li><a href="#juvenile-expungement">Juvenile Expungement</a></li>
<li><a href="#self-defense-expungement">Self Defense Expungement</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Pursuing expungement under the incorrect option could foreclose expungement eligibility under another more favorable expungement statute. Therefore, it is important to pursue expungement under the most favorable expungement option available.</p>
<h3 id="administrative-expungement">Administrative Expungement</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/943.0581">Florida Statute 943.0581</a> allows for the administrative expungement of nonjudicial records created as a result of an arrest made contrary to law or by mistake.</p>
<p>Administrative Expungement is exceedingly rare and usually limited to scenarios where law enforcement arrest the wrong person, recognize their mistake, and promptly release the person.</p>
<h3 id="court-ordered-expungement">Court-Ordered Expungement</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/943.0585">Florida Statute 943.0585</a>, known as Court Ordered Expungement, allows a person to expunge the criminal history records of a case that was completely dismissed provided the person has not previously been <a href="#sentencing_judgment">adjudicated guilty</a> of any criminal offense nor had a previous criminal case sealed or expunged in Florida.</p>
<p>Court Ordered Expungement is the most commonly available form of expungement. However, a Court Ordered Expungement can only granted once in a lifetime. As a result, every attempt should be made to obtain expungement under another statute if available.</p>
<p>Cases that were not completely dismissed, may be eligible for <a href="#sealing">Court Ordered Sealing</a>.</p>
<h3 id="human-trafficking-victim-expungement">Human Trafficking Victim Expungement</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/943.0583">Florida Statute 943.0583</a> allows victims of human trafficking to expunge criminal records of most non-violent criminal acts committed while they were a victim of human trafficking.</p>
<p>There is no limitation on how many Human Trafficking expungements a person can obtain and prior criminal history will not prevent a person from pursuing a Human Trafficking Expungement.</p>
<h3 id="juvenile-expungement">Juvenile Expungement</h3>
<p>There are three forms of expungement available to juveniles: <a href="#automatic-expungement">Automatic Expungement</a>, <a href="#early-juvenile-expungement">Early Juvenile Expungement</a>, and <a href="#juvenile-diversion-expungement">Juvenile Diversion Expungement</a>.</p>
<h4 id="automatic-expungement">Automatic Expungement</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/943.0515">Florida Statute 943.0515(1)(a)</a> provides for the Automatic Expungement of juvenile criminal records that were dismissed or resulted in a <a href="#sentencing_judgment">withhold of adjudication</a> at the age of 21. However, if the criminal case resulted in the juvenile being committed (juvenile prison), the Automatic Expungement will not occur until the juvenile turns 26 and has not been convicted of a felony as an adult. Once automatically expunged, the criminal records will no longer appear on a background check.</p>
<h4 id="early-juvenile-expungement">Early Juvenile Expungement</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/943.0515">Florida Statute 943.0515(1)(b)(2)</a> allows a person ages 18 to 21 to have their juvenile criminal history records expunged early by FDLE provided they have not been charged with, or found to have committed, any criminal offense within the preceding 5 years of the expungement.</p>
<h4 id="juvenile-diversion-expungement">Juvenile Diversion Expungement</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/943.0582">Florida Statute 943.0582</a> allows a juvenile to expunge the nonjudicial arrest records of a non-violent offense that was resolved through the successful completion of a prearrest or post-arrest juvenile diversion program.</p>
<h3 id="self-defense-expungement">Self Defense Expungement</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/943.0578">Florida Statute 943.0578</a>, allows for the expungement of criminal history records that were dismissed because it was determined the person acted in lawful <a href="#self_defense">self-defense</a>.</p>
<p>A self defense expungement is only available if the prosecutor specifically dismissed a case based on self defense, a court granted a Motion to Dismiss based on Self Defense, or a jury acquitted a person based on self defense.</p>
<p>Unlike Court Ordered Expungement, prior criminal history will not disqualify a person from expungement of a case dismissed based on self defense and there is no limitation on the number of self defense expungements a person can obtain.</p>
<h2>Effect of an Expungement</h2>
<p>When a criminal case is expunged, all electronic and physical records possessed by law enforcement are destroyed and the record maintained by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) and the court are sealed and made non-public. The records maintained by FDLE and the court are confidential under Florida law and can only be disclosed under limited circumstances explained below.</p>
<p>Most importantly, once an expungement is granted, a criminal background check will no longer reveal the criminal history from the case and the person has the lawful right to deny the existence of the criminal history under Florida law.</p>
<h3>Right to Deny</h3>
<p>The right to deny the historical fact of a person's criminal history, such as the arrest or prosecution, is governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the person is being asked to disclose their criminal history and a person's ability to deny the existence of the criminal record is governed by that jurisdiction's law.</p>
<h3>Florida Law</h3>
<p>Under Florida law, a person can lawfully deny the existence of sealed or expunged criminal history records subject to several statutory exceptions outlined in <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/943.0585">Florida Statute 943.0585(6)</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, these exceptions require the disclosure of sealed or expunged criminal criminal history records when the person is:</p>
<ol>
<li>A candidate for employment with a criminal justice agency.</li>
<li>A defendant in a criminal prosecution.</li>
<li>Petitioning to have another criminal case sealed or expunged.</li>
<li>A candidate for admission to The Florida Bar.</li>
<li>Applying for a concealed weapons license in the State of Florida.</li>
<li>Seeking to be employed by, licensed by, or contracted with the:
									<ol>
<li>Department of Children and Family Services,</li>
<li>Agency for Health Care Administration,</li>
<li>Agency for Persons with Disabilities,</li>
<li>Department of Juvenile Justice,</li>
<li>A seaport listed in <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/311.09">Florida Statute 311.09</a>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Seeking to work directly or indirectly in a position having direct contact with children, disabled persons, or elderly persons.</li>
<li>Seeking to be employed or licensed by the Department of Education or work in any school or child care facility.</li>
<li>Seeking to be licensed by the Division of Insurance within the Department of Financial Services.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Federal Law</h3>
<p>The federal government is considered a separate jurisdiction and disclosure of sealed or expunged criminal history is governed by federal law, even if a person is physically in the State of Florida.</p>
<p>While most federal agencies do not require the disclosure of sealed or expunged criminal history records, there are several notable exceptions. For example, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service requires applicants to disclose sealed or expunged criminal history records. Also, expunged criminal history records must be disclosed when completing Form SF-86 as part of a national security clearance application.</p>
<p>Generally, though, if a federal questionnaire or application specifically asks for criminal history that was sealed or expunged, then it should be disclosed. If the question does not specifically ask for sealed or expunged history, it need not be disclosed.</p>

<div id="faq-list">
<div class="faq-entry">
<h2><a class="question" href="#q1">How much does it cost to have a Florida criminal record sealed or expunged?</a></h2>
<div class="answer" id="q1">
<p>Depending on the nature of the underlying offense, I charge a flat fee which includes all court costs and related expenses. If the case is outside of the Central Florida area and a hearing is required there is an additional travel fee.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-entry">
<h2><a class="question" href="#q2">What is the difference between sealing and expungement of a criminal record?</a></h2>
<div class="answer" id="q2">
<p>In Florida, sealing and Expungement of your criminal records are two similar, but separate processes.</p>
<p>Sealing of criminal records results in all of the criminal history records related to a criminal case being made confidential and exempt from disclosure to the public.</p>
<p>Expungement of criminal records results in the destruction of all physical records related to your criminal case held by a criminal justice agency and the court file being made confidential and exempt from disclosure to the public.</p>
<p>The primary distinction between sealed and expunged criminal records, is that sealed records are retained by the courts and law enforcement agencies who possess them and they are prohibited from divulging the history of the arrest to the public. On the other hand, expungement requires law enforcement to physically destroy their criminal records and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Court maintain a sealed record of the arrest history.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-entry">
<h2><a class="question" href="#q3">Why can't I just expunge my criminal record instead of sealing it?</a></h2>
<div class="answer" id="q3">
<p>By law, only a case that was completely dismissed can be expunged.</p>
<p>If you entered a plea of guilty or no contest and adjudication of guilt was withheld, the law only allows you to have your records s<a href="#public_criminal_post_conviction_sealing">ealed</a>.

<h1 itemprop="name">Florida Criminal History Records</h1>
<p>Below are answers to basic questions about Florida criminal history records.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#definition">What is a Criminal Record?</a></li>
<li><a href="#maintenance">Who Maintains Criminal Records?</a></li>
<li><a href="#access">Who Can Access my Criminal Record?</a></li>
<li><a href="#juvenile">Are Juvenile Records Treated Differently than Adult Records?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="definition">What is a Criminal Record?</h2>
<p>Your criminal record (also known as your criminal history) is the electronic and written documentation of any contact you have had with the criminal justice system. This includes field interviews, arrests, or criminal court cases you have had, regardless of how the cases were resolved.</p>
<h3>Types of Criminal Records</h3>
<p>There are two types of criminal records maintained in Florida: Non-Judicial Records and Judicial Records.</p>
<h4>Non-Judicial Records</h4>
<p>Non-judicial records are those records maintained by federal, state, and local government agencies. They includes minor records such as field interview reports and unsubstantiated complaints. They also include arrest reports, incident reports, and mug shots.</p>
<h4>Judicial Records</h4>
<p>Judicial records are records maintained by the Clerk of Court as a result of a person being arrested formally charged with a crime. They include charging affidavits, arrest warrants, formal charging documents, court opinions, and court minutes among other things.</p>
<h2 id="maintenance">Who Maintains Criminal Records?</h2>
<p>Criminal justice agencies maintain your criminal history at the national, state, and local level and do not necessarily share their information with each other.</p>
<h3 id="NCIC">National Criminal History</h3>
<p>The <acronym title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</acronym> maintains the National Crime Information Center database. The <acronym title="National Crime Information Center">NCIC</acronym> is a computerized index of all national and state level criminal records, warrants, stolen property, and missing person reports.</p>
<h3>Florida’s Computerized Criminal History</h3>
<p>The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) maintains the Florida Computerized Criminal History Central Repository database (CCH) and the Florida Crime Information Center database.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Florida Computerized Criminal History Central Repository">CCH</abbr> database consists of all of a person’s arrests in Florida and the final disposition; whether it is by dismissal, plea, or trial.</p>
<p>The Florida Crime Information Center database consists of any warrants or domestic violence injunctions a person may have.</p>
<h3>Local Criminal History</h3>
<p>Local criminal history primarily consists of any documented contact you have had with a specific law enforcement agency’s jurisdiction. This would include if they did a field interview with you, but did not arrest you.</p>
<p>Even though local law enforcement may maintain internal records of field interviews or other non-arrest contact, they generally do not forward this information to other law enforcement agencies or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement unless a specific request is made.</p>
<h2 id="access">Who Can Access my Criminal Record?</h2>
<h3>National Criminal History Access</h3>
<p>A national criminal history check through <acronym title="National Crime Information Center">NCIC</acronym> is unavailable to the public at large. Access is primarily limited to law enforcement, governmental agencies, and companies with government contracts.</p>
<h3>Florida Criminal History Check</h3>
<p>A Florida criminal history check through <abbr title="Florida Computerized Criminal History Central Repository">CCH</abbr> is available to the public at large through <acronym title="Florida Department of Law Enforcement">FDLE</acronym> and includes all arrests and court dispositions, <strong>even if adjudication was withhold</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cchinet.fdle.state.fl.us/"><acronym title="Florida Department of Law Enforcement">FDLE</acronym> Website with Access to Florida Criminal Records Database</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Local Criminal History Check</h3>
<p>A local criminal history check is available to the public at large, but usually must be made in writing to the specific law enforcement agency with the information. It usually only consists of field contact reports and arrest information.</p>
<h2 id="juvenile">Are Juvenile Records Treated Differently than Adult Records?</h2>

<h1 itemprop="name">Sealing Criminal Records in Florida</h1>
<p>Florida law provides for two forms of sealing of criminal records:
							
							<ul>
<li><a href="#automatic-sealing">Automatic Sealing</a></li>
<li><a href="#court-ordered-sealing">Court Ordered Sealing</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Automatic Sealing, Court Ordered Sealing, and Court Ordered Expungement</h2>
<p>Automatic Sealing, Court Ordered Sealing, and <a href="expungement.html#court-ordered-expungement">Court Ordered Expungement</a> are functionally similar in that they each result in the removal of the arrest history from a criminal background check and allow for a qualified right to deny the underlying criminal arrest history. However, they differ in their eligibility requirements and the extent to which the underlying criminal history is completely removed.</p>
<p>Whether to pursue a sealing or an expungement depends on how the underlying criminal case was resolved. If the case was dismissed outright, either Automatic Sealing or  expungement should be pursued. If the case resulted in a <a href="#sentencing_judgment">withhold of adjudication</a> and some form of punishment (i.e. a fine, court costs, probation, or jail), Court Ordered Sealing should be pursued.</p>
<p>The primary difference between Automatic Sealing, Court Ordered Sealing, and Court Ordered Expungement is that Automatic Sealing only results in the sealing of non-judicial court records held by law enforcement and the court file remains public. Court Ordered Sealing results in the sealing of both the non judicial records held by law enforcement and the judicial records held by the court. And Court Ordered Expungement results in the destruction of the non-judicial records and the sealing of the judicial records.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-sealing">Automatic Sealing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/0943.0595">Florida Statute 943.0595</a> provides for the automatic sealing of most nonjudicial criminal arrest records that were completely dismissed.</p>
<p>However, a person is ineligible for Automatic Sealing if their case resulted in the formal filing of either  forcible felony or a felony sex crime, regardless of whether the case was ultimately dismissed. In this situation, the person would only be eligible for <a href="expungement.html#court-ordered-expungement">Court Ordered Expungement</a>.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Automatic Sealing</h3>
<p>When a criminal case is Automatically Sealed, all electronic and physical non-judicial records possessed by law enforcement are sealed and made non-public and can only be disclosed under limited circumstances. However, the judicial records held by the court remain publicly available.</p>
<p>Most importantly, once a case is sealed, a criminal background check will no longer reveal the criminal arrest history for the case and the person has a <a href="#right-to-deny">right to deny</a> the existence of the criminal history under Florida law.</p>
<h2 id="court-ordered-sealing">Court Ordered Sealing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/0943.059">Florida Statute 943.059</a> provides for Court Ordered Sealing when a case resulted in a <a href="#sentencing_judgment">withhold of adjudication</a> on any offense that is not <a href="#ineligible-offenses">ineligible for Court Ordered Sealing</a>.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Court Ordered Sealing</h3>
<p>When Court Ordered Sealing is granted, all electronic and physical records possessed by both the court and law enforcement are sealed and made non-public. These records are confidential under Florida law and can only be disclosed under limited circumstances.</p>
<p>Most importantly, once a case is sealed, a criminal background check will no longer reveal the criminal history from the case and the person has the lawful <a href="#right-to-deny">right to deny</a> the existence of the criminal history under Florida law.</p>
<h3>Court Ordered Sealing Eligibility</h3>
<p>A person is eligible for Court Ordered Sealing if they:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have not previously obtained a court ordered sealing or expungement in Florida.</li>
<li>Have never been <a href="#sentencing_judgment">adjudicated guilty</a> of any criminal offense in Florida.</li>
<li>Are not currently under supervision, such as probation, house arrest, or pretrial release.</li>
<li>Did not enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere (No Contest) to an <a href="#ineligible-offenses">ineligible offense</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="ineligible-offenses">Ineligible Offenses</h4>
<p>A person is ineligible for Court Ordered Sealing if they pled guilty or nolo contendere (no contest) to any of the following crimes, regardless of whether <a href="#sentencing_judgment">adjudication was withheld</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="right-to-deny">Right to Deny</h2>
<p>A person who's case was sealed has the qualified right to deny the historical fact of a person's criminal history, such as the arrest or prosecution, subject to the law of the jurisdiction where a person is being asked to disclose their criminal history.</p>
<h3>Florida Law</h3>
<p>Under Florida law, a person can lawfully deny the existence of sealed criminal history records except as provided in <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/943.0585">section 943.0585(6)</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, these exceptions require the disclosure of sealed criminal criminal history records when the person is:</p>
<ol>
<li>A candidate for employment with a criminal justice agency.</li>
<li>A defendant in a criminal prosecution.</li>
<li>Petitioning to have another criminal case sealed or expunged.</li>
<li>A candidate for admission to The Florida Bar.</li>
<li>Applying for a concealed weapons license in the State of Florida.</li>
<li>Seeking to be employed by, licensed by, or contracted with the:
									<ol>
<li>Department of Children and Family Services,</li>
<li>Agency for Health Care Administration,</li>
<li>Agency for Persons with Disabilities,</li>
<li>Department of Juvenile Justice,</li>
<li>A seaport listed in Florida Statute 311.09.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Seeking to work directly or indirectly in a position having direct contact with children, disabled persons, or elderly persons.</li>
<li>Seeking to be employed or licensed by the Department of Education or work in any school or child care facility.</li>
<li>Seeking to be licensed by the Division of Insurance within the Department of Financial Services.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Federal Law</h3>
<p>The federal government is considered a separate jurisdiction and disclosure of sealed criminal history is governed by federal law, even if a person is physically in the State of Florida.</p>
<p>While most federal agencies do not require the disclosure of sealed criminal history records, there are several notable exceptions. For example, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service requires applicants to disclose sealed criminal history records. Also, sealed criminal history records must be disclosed when completing Form SF-86 as part of a national security clearance application.</p>
<p>Generally, though, if a federal questionnaire or application specifically asks for criminal history that was sealed or expunged, then it should be disclosed. If the question does not specifically ask for sealed or expunged history, it need not be disclosed.</p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Florida Criminal Sentencing Law</h1>
<blockquote class="half">Every criminal case is unique and resolved differently.</blockquote>

<p>In general, the more serious the crime, the more serious the sentence.</p>
<p>While misdemeanor sentences are usually determined on a more ad hoc basis and allow for creative negotiation, felony sentences are frequently dictated by statutory factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#penalties">Statutory Penalties</a></li>
<li><a href="#enhancements">Sentencing Enhancements</a></li>
<li><a href="#criminal_punishment_code">Florida Sentencing Guidelines</a></li>
<li><a href="#youthful_offender">Youthful Offender Sentencing Options</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentence Determination</h2>
<p>Ultimately though, the terms and conditions of a sentence will be determined by whether:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <a href="#negotiated-plea">Negotiated Plea</a> was entered;</li>
<li>An <a href="#open-plea">Open Plea</a> was entered (meaning no sentencing agreement was reached); or</li>
<li>A <a href="#guilty-verdict">Guilty Verdict</a> was returned.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="negotiated-plea">Negotiated Plea</h3>
<p>If a plea was entered pursuant to an agreed upon resolution, then sentencing is straightforward and the judge will impose the agreed upon sentence. As a result, it will be unnecessary to present any character evidence or mitigation during the hearing.</p>
<p>If portions of the agreed upon resolution are objectionable to the judge, then the sentencing will be stopped and the parties will either adjust the terms to satisfy the judge or agree to any additional terms the judge would require before accepting the plea.</p>
<h3 id="open-plea">Open Plea</h3>
<p>An open plea means that there has been no agreed upon sentence reached with the prosecutor. As a result the judge will be given the responsibility of determining an appropriate sentence.</p>
<p>Open pleas are usually utilized in two situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>The prosecutor will not make an offer; or</li>
<li>The defense attorney believes a judge will impose a more reasonable sentence than what the prosecutor is offering.</li>
</ol>
<p>Importantly, when an open plea is entered, a judge can impose any sentence, so long as it falls between the minimum and maximum penalties authorized by law.</p>
<h3 id="guilty-verdict">Guilty Verdict</h3>
<p>If you are found guilty by a jury, it will be necessary to present witnesses to testify to your character and to what type of sentence would be appropriate. If you are convicted of a felony offense, and it is your first offense, a judge will order a <a href="#PSI">Pre-Sentence investigation</a>.</p>
<p>It is at the sentencing hearing where mitigation and character evidence will be presented to the judge and an appropriate sentence will be requested.</p>
<h2 id="PSI">Pre-Sentence Investigation (PSI)</h2>
<p>If a first time offender enters an open plea or is found guilty at trial for a felony offense, a judge will postpone sentencing and order what is called a Pre-Sentence Investigation (PSI). The purposes of the PSI is for a Probation Officer to investigate your background and make an individualized sentencing recommendation to the judge.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Pre-Sentence Investigation">PSI</abbr> is a comprehensive background check conducted by a Florida Department of Corrections probation officer. The officer will question you, your family, friends, witnesses in the case, and your attorney in order to prepare the PSI.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Pre-Sentence Investigation">PSI</abbr> includes the cause and circumstances of the crime, prior criminal history, if any, character references, and background about family, education, employment and health. The <abbr title="Pre-Sentence Investigation">PSI</abbr> will also include information about future goals and career plans of the defendant.</p>
<h2>Florida Sentencing Options</h2>
<p>At a sentencing hearings, a judge can impose any combination of the following <a href="#penalties">sentencing penalties</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#fines">Fines</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#probation">Probation</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#community-control">Community Control</a> (House Arrest); and</li>
<li><a href="#incarceration">Incarceration</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fines">Fines</h3>
<p>Although they are generally reserved for misdemeanor and drug crimes, a judge can always impose a fine as part of any sentence.</p>
<h3 id="probation">Probation</h3>
<p>Judges often consider probation sufficient to punish an individual and protect society; especially for first time, non-violent offenders.</p>
<p>A person placed on probation must report at least once a month to a probation officer who will supervise them to make sure that fines are paid, restitution is paid, community service is performed, and special conditions are completed.</p>
<p><strong>Probation is a privilege -- not a right.</strong> If placed on probation, a probationer must abide by the following general requirements in addition to any special conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Report regularly to a probation officer;</li>
<li>Notify probation before changing residences, employment, or traveling out of the county; and</li>
<li>Lead a law-abiding life and not committing any other crimes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="community-control">Community Control</h3>
<p>Community Control, also known as House Arrest, is similar to probation except it is more intense and requires a greater amount of supervision on the part of the Probation Officer. Many times people call community control house arrest. This is not completely accurate but it helps to illustrate the greater degree of supervision required in a community control sentence.</p>
<h3 id="incarceration">Incarceration</h3>
<p>By its very definition, any crime is as an offense that is punishable by the possibility of incarceration. If a person is found guilty, pled to the bench, or violated probation, the judge will always have the ability to sentence the person to jail, limited only by the maximum penalty set by law for the underlying offense.</p>
<h2>Violation of Probation</h2>
<p>If you violate any of these probation conditions, or any special conditions required by the judge, the judge may sentence you to prison.</p>
<p>If the violation of probation is a crime committed by you while on probation, the judge can revoke your probation without waiting until you are convicted of the new charge. A probation violation hearing will be held by the judge without a jury.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Florida’s Criminal Punishment Code</h1>
<p>Florida utilizes the Criminal Punishment Code (CPC) scoring system to determine the minimum allowable sentence for all felony crimes. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>Under the <abbr title="Criminal Punishment Code">CPC</abbr>, every felony offense is assigned an Offense Level between 1 and 10, which then carries a point value. Generally the more serious the crime, the higher the offense level.</p>
<p>In addition to the assigned offense levels, the <abbr title="Criminal Punishment Code">CPC</abbr> also assess additional points when the underlying crimes involve victim injury, legal status violations, or firearm possession.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the point value for a person’s crimes are added together using the <a href="http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/sen_cpcm/cpc_manual.pdf"><abbr title="Criminal Punishment Code">CPC</abbr> Scoresheet Preparation Manual</a> and if the total sentencing points equal 44 points or more, the person is facing a mandatory prison sentence (commonly referred to as scoring prison). If the number is less than 44 points, or qualifies under the <a href="#chronic-substance-abuser-exception">Chronic Substance Abuser Exception</a>, the person is eligible for probation or community control.</p>
<h3 id="chronic-substance-abuser-exception">Chronic Substance Abuser Exception</h3>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2012/948.20">Florida Statute 948.20</a>, if a person convicted of a non-violent felony scores less than 60 points and is found to be a “chronic substance abuser,” a judge may sentence the person to drug offender probation in lieu of prison.
		<h2>Preparing the <abbr title="Criminal Punishment Code">CPC</abbr> Scoresheet</h2>
<p>To determine what a person scores, the crimes are designated as Primary Offense, Additional Offenses, and Prior Record at sentencing.</p>
<p>The Primary Offense is the crime with the highest offense level. If two crimes are the same offense level, only one will be designated as the Primary Offense and the other will be placed as an Additional Offense. Finally, all past criminal history is placed under Prior Record.</p>
<p>The offenses are then placed on the <abbr title="Criminal Punishment Code">CPC</abbr> scoresheet and the amount of points assigned is determined by the Offense Level of the Primary Offense, Additional Offenses, and Prior Record.</p>
<p>As can be expected, point value is higher when the offense appears as a Primary Offense than as an Additional Offense or Prior Record.</p>

<h3>Additional Sentencing Factors</h3>
<p>In addition to the Offense Level points, the <abbr title="Criminal Punishment Code">CPC</abbr> also assesses additional points when certain circumstances are present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Victim Injury</li>
<li>Legal Status Violations</li>
<li>Community Sanction Violations</li>
<li>Firearm / Semi-Automatic Weapons</li>
<li>Prior Serious Felonies</li>
<li>Enhancement Multipliers</li>
</ul>
<p>Many times a person’s ultimate score can be significantly increased because of these factors.</p>
<h3>Calculating the Point Total</h3>
<p>To determine a person’s point total - and whether they score prison - the Primary Offense, Additional Offenses, Prior Record and Additional Sentencing Factors are individually sub-totaled and then added together.</p>
<p>If the total number is less than 44 points, the calculation stops and the person is eligible for probation or community control.</p>
<p>If the total number is greater than 44 points, then a sentencing formula is applied to calculate the lowest permissible prison sentence by subtracting 28 from the total points and then multiplying that number by 0.75.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Total Points - 28) * .75 = Lowest Permissible Prison Sentence (In Months)</li>
</ul>

<h1 itemprop="name">Downward Departure Sentencing Options in Florida</h1>
<p>Under Florida law, a person convicted of a felony must be sentenced pursuant to the Florida <a href="#criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a> (CPC). If a person scores prison under the Criminal Punishment Code, a judge must sentence the person to prison unless the court finds valid grounds for a downward departure.</p>
<p>The decision to depart from the minimum sentence mandated by the Criminal Punishment Code is a two part process. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small> First, the court must decide whether there is evidence of mitigating circumstances that would support a downward departure sentence. Second, the court to must determine whether it should impose a downward departure sentence.</p>
<p>Importantly, imposing a downward departure sentence is entirely a discretionary decision. Meaning that even if a judge finds evidence supporting a downward departure, the judge is not required to impose a downward departure sentence.</p>
<h2>Mitigating Factors</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/921.0026">Florida Statute 921.0026(2)</a> provides a list of mitigating circumstances under which a downward departure sentence is justified. These mitigating circumstances are as follows: </p>
<ol>
<li>The departure results from a legitimate, uncoerced plea bargain.</li>
<li>The defendant was an accomplice to the offense and was a relatively minor participant in the criminal conduct.</li>
<li>The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminal nature of the conduct or to conform that conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.</li>
<li>The defendant requires specialized treatment for a mental disorder that is unrelated to substance abuse or addiction or for a physical disability, and the defendant is amenable to treatment.</li>
<li>The need for payment of restitution to the victim outweighs the need for a prison sentence.</li>
<li>The victim was an initiator, willing participant, aggressor, or provoker of the incident.</li>
<li>The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the domination of another person.</li>
<li>Before the identity of the defendant was determined, the victim was substantially compensated.</li>
<li>The defendant cooperated with the state to resolve the current offense or any other offense.</li>
<li>The offense was committed in an unsophisticated manner and was an isolated incident for which the defendant has shown remorse.</li>
<li>At the time of the offense the defendant was too young to appreciate the consequences of the offense.</li>
<li>The defendant is to be sentenced as a youthful offender.</li>
<li>The defendant’s offense is a nonviolent felony, the defendant’s Criminal Punishment Code scoresheet total sentence points under s. 921.0024 are 60 points or fewer, and the court determines that the defendant is amenable to the services of a post-adjudicatory treatment-based drug court program and is otherwise qualified to participate in the program as part of the sentence.</li>
<li>The defendant was making a good faith effort to obtain or provide medical assistance for an individual experiencing a drug-related overdose.</li>

<h1 itemprop="name">Withholding Adjudication of Guilt and Adjudication of Guilt</h1>
<blockquote class="half">If a judge withholds adjudication of guilt, the person avoids being formally branded a convicted criminal.</blockquote>
<p>If a person enters a guilty plea, no contest plea, or is found guilty at trial to a crime, a judge must render a final judgment regarding the person’s guilt.</p>
<p>Subject to certain <a href="#statutory-limitations">statutory limitations</a>, a judge may either adjudicate a person guilty or withhold adjudication of guilt. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>If a judge adjudicates a person guilty, they are considered to have been formally convicted of the crime. And in the case of a person adjudicated guilty of a felony, the person is considered a “convicted felon.”</p>
<p>However, if a judge withholds adjudication of guilt, the person avoids being formally branded a convicted criminal, the consequent loss of civil rights, and being subject to other collateral consequences triggered when a person is adjudicated guilty. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h2>Withholding Adjudication of Guilt: The Conviction Misnomer</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, while the court system and most lay persons do not consider a judgment withholding adjudication of guilt to be a conviction, it is still considered a conviction for statutory purposes.</p>
<p>Which begs the question, what is the benefit of having adjudication of guilt withheld if you are still legally considered to have been convicted of the offense?</p>
<h3>Advantages of Withholding Adjudication of Guilt</h3>
<p>Under Florida law, a person who receives a withhold of adjudication of guilt can lawfully deny having been convicted of the underlying crime; cannot be impeached with the crime when testifying in future court proceedings; will not lose their civil rights, and, most importantly, maintains their eligibility to petition to seal their criminal record.</p>
<p>Additionally, a judgment withholding adjudication of guilt does not trigger certain collateral consequences that accompany an adjudication of guilt. The most common example being that a person adjudicated guilty of a drug offense loses their driver’s license for one year, whereas a person does not lose their driver’s license if they receive a withhold of adjudication of guilt.</p>
<h3>Disadvantages of Withholding Adjudication of Guilt</h3>
<p>If a person reoffends, a prior judgment withholding adjudication of guilt will be treated as a conviction by a court for purposes of sentencing. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>Under Federal law, a judgment withholding adjudication of guilt is considered a conviction for immigration purposes and can be used to initiate removal proceedings against an immigrant. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<p>A criminal case that results in a judgment withholding adjudication of guilt will still appear on a criminal background check and can be considered by a private employer when making a hiring decision. <small><a href="#references">[5]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="statutory-limitations">Statutory Limitations to Withholding Adjudication of Guilt</h2>
<p>While there is no limitation on a judge’s ability to adjudicate a person guilty of a crime, a judge may only withhold adjudication of guilt if the judge believes the person is unlikely to engage in future criminal conduct and that the ends of justice and the welfare of society will be protected by doing so.</p>
<p>However, the judge’s ability to withhold adjudication of guilt is statutory limited by the degree of felony a person is charged with and the person’s prior criminal record. <small><a href="#references">[6]</a></small></p>
<h3>Capital, Life, and First Degree Felony</h3>
<p>A judge may not withhold adjudication of guilt if a person enters a guilty or no contest plea, or is found guilty by a jury of a capital, life, or first degree felony regardless of the mitigating circumstances.</p>
<h3>Second Degree Felony with Prior Withhold of Adjudication of Guilt</h3>
<p>If a person charged with a second degree felony has previously received a withhold of adjudication of guilt on an unrelated felony and enters a guilty or no contest plea, or is found guilty by a jury of the second degree felony, a judge may not withhold adjudication of guilt.</p>
<h3>Second Degree Felony with No Prior Withhold of Adjudication of Guilt</h3>
<p>If a person charged with a second degree felony has never previously received a withhold of adjudication of guilt on a felony and enters a guilty or no contest plea, or is found guilty by a jury of the second degree felony, a judge may withhold adjudication of guilt if:</p>
<ol>
<li>The state attorney requests in writing that adjudication be withheld; or</li>
<li>The court makes written findings that withholding of adjudication is reasonably justified based on mitigating circumstances enumerated in <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/921.0026">Florida Statute 921.0026</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Third Degree Felony</h3>
<p>A judge may not withhold adjudication of guilt on a third degree felony offense if the defendant has had adjudication of guilt withheld on two or more previous felonies.</p>
<h3>First and Second Degree Misdemeanors</h3>
<p>A judge may withhold adjudication of guilt on any misdemeanor offense so long as there is not a more specific statutory prohibition to withholding adjudication of guilt.</p>
<p>For example, under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/316.656">Florida Statute 316.656</a>, a court is prohibited from withholding adjudication of guilt for any person found guilty of <a href="##crimes/traffic/dui/">DUI</a> as a result of a plea of guilty or no contest.</p>
<h3>Juvenile Offenses</h3>
<p>If a person is prosecuted in the juvenile justice system, a court may withhold adjudication of guilt on all felony or misdemeanor offenses.</p>
<p>However, if a minor is prosecuted in the adult criminal justice system, the judge must follow the requirements of <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/775.08435">Florida Statute 775.08435</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Misdemeanor">Misdemeanor Offenses</h2>
<p>Misdemeanor offenses are crimes that are punishable by less than one year in jail. Unless charged with other felony offenses, misdemeanors are handled by a county court judge and are considered less serious crimes than felony offenses. Misdemeanors are categorized as either first degree or second degree misdemeanors.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Second Degree Misdemeanor</dt>
<dd>A second-degree misdemeanor is a crime punishable by no more than sixty days in jail, six months of probation, and a $500 fine.</dd>

<p>Under the <a href="#criminal_punishment_code"><abbr title="Criminal Punishment Code">CPC</abbr></a>, commonly referred to as a scoresheet, each felony is scored a specific amount of points based on upon a statutory severity ranking, which are determined by the Florida legislature regardless of statutory degree.</p>
<p>The higher the level a felony is designated, the more points that will appear on your <a href="#criminal_punishment_code"><abbr title="Criminal Punishment Code">CPC</abbr></a> scoresheet.

<h1 itemprop="name">Youthful Offender Sentencing in Florida</h1>
<p>Florida has enacted an alternative sentencing scheme for youthful offenders who committed a felony offense before their 21st birthday. <small><a href="#FN1">[1]</a></small></p>
<h2>Eligibility for Youthful Offender Sentencing</h2>
<p>A court has the discretion to impose a Youthful Offender sentence under the following circumstances:</p>
<ol>
<li>The defendant was younger than 21 years of age on the day the crime was committed;</li>
<li>The defendant was found guilty of, or pled nolo contendere or guilty to, any non-capital or non-life felony crime; and</li>
<li>The defendant has not previously been sentenced as a youthful offender.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Youthful Offender Sentencing Disposition</h2>
<p>Before a person can be sentenced as a Youthful Offender, a court must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine that a person qualifies for Youthful Offender sentencing; and</li>
<li>Agree to exercise the discretion to impose a Youthful Offender sentencing</li>
</ol>
<p>If both of these conditions exist, the court may impose any combination of the following penalties notwithstanding the mandatory minimum prison sentence required under the adult <a href="#criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Up to six (6) years of probation or community control.</li>
<li>Up to 365 days of incarceration as a condition of probation or community control, which shall be served in either a:
								<ol>
<li>County Jail Facility;</li>
<li>Department Probation and Restitution Center; or</li>
<li>Community Residential Facility</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A split sentence of prison and probation, with the prison term not to exceed four (4) years and the total sentence not to exceed six (6) years.</li>
<li>Up to six (6) years prison.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Adjudication</h3>
<p>If a court sentences a Youthful Offender to probation, community control, or jail as a condition of probation or community control, a judge may, but is not required to, <a href="#judgment">withhold adjudication of guilt</a>; thereby allowing the youthful offender’s civil rights to be maintained.</p>
<h2>Youthful Offender Sentencing Limitations</h2>
<h3>Violation of Probation</h3>
<p>If a person placed on probation or community control under the Youthful Offender Act commits a technical violation of probation, such as absconding or failing to complete a behavioral improvement course, the person may be sentenced up to six (6) years in prison if found in willful violation of probation.</p>
<p>However, if a person placed on probation or community control under the Youthful Offender Act commits a new criminal offense while on probation or community control, the person can be resentenced up to the maximum allowable prison sentence under the adult <a href="#criminal_punishment_code">Criminal Punishment Code</a> notwithstanding their original designation as a Youthful Offender. <small><a href="#FN2">[2]</a></small></p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Federal Violation Notices in Florida</h1>
<blockquote>Federal violation notices can be issued for misdemeanors committed on federal property.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">In Florida, federal violation notices are issued by federal law enforcement officers to people who commit misdemeanors on federal property such as a military base, national park, or post office.</p>
<p>In Central Florida, federal violation notices are most frequently issued to people who commit minor criminal offenses at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Orlando Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division, or Patrick Air Force Base.</p>
<p>Federal Violation Notices issued in Brevard and Orange Counties are prosecuted before a magistrate judge in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Orlando, Florida.</p>
<h3>Authority to Enforce Florida Laws</h3>
<p>Under the Assimilative Crimes Act, the United States Attorney General can prosecute violations of Florida criminal law committed on federal property when the criminal offense is not covered by a corresponding federal law.</p>
<p>Examples of Florida crimes frequently prosecuted under the Assimilative Crimes Act are <a href="#crimes/assault/">Assault</a>, <a href="#public_order_disorderly_conduct">Disorderly Conduct</a>, <a href="#crimes/traffic/dui/">DUI</a>, <a href="#theft_petit_theft">shoplifting</a>, and <a href="#public_order_criminal_mischief">vandalism</a> among others.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Federal Violation Notices</h2>
<p>Under federal law, only misdemeanors and petty offenses can be prosecuted pursuant to a federal violation notice.</p>
<p>A misdemeanor is any crime carries a maximum penalty of one year or less in jail and federal law divides misdemeanors into Class A, B, and C misdemeanors.</p>
<p>A petty offense carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and encompasses Class B and C misdemeanors and civil infractions and carry fewer procedural protections than Class A misdemeanors.</p>
<h3>Class A Misdemeanor</h3>
<p>Class A misdemeanors are punishable by up to one (1) year in jail, five (5) years of probation, or $100,000 in fines.</p>
<h3>Class B Misdemeanor</h3>
<p>Class B misdemeanors are punishable by up to six (6) months in jail, five (5) years of probation, or $5,000 in fines.</p>
<h3>Class C Misdemeanor</h3>
<p>Class C misdemeanors are punishable by up to sixty (60) days in jail, five (5) years of probation, or $5,000 in fines.</p>
<h3>Infraction</h3>
<p>Federal infractions are punishable by up to five (5) days in jail, one (1) year of probation, or $5,000 fines.</p>
<h3>Driver License Consequences</h3>
<p>Depending on how a federal violation is resolved, the disposition may trigger driver license penalties applicable under Florida law.</p>
<p>For example, a DUI conviction will be reported to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV) and the DUI conviction will trigger an administrative suspension of the person’s Florida driver license.</p>
<h2>Criminal History Consequences</h2>
<p>Federal violation notices are processed and maintained by the U.S. <a href="https://www.cvb.uscourts.gov/">Central Violations Bureau</a> (CVP).</p>
<p>Because of how <abbr title="Central Violations Bureau">CVP</abbr> maintains Federal Violation Notices, they will not appear on a state or federal criminal or traffic background check unless the U.S. Magistrate Court reports the final disposition to the Florida Crime Information Center (FCIC), the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), or  Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr>.</p>
<p>Generally, the determination of whether a federal violation notice is reported to <abbr title="Florida Crime Information Center">FCIC</abbr>, <abbr title="National Crime Information Center">NCIC</abbr>, or Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr> depends upon the terms of the resolution reached with federal prosecutors.</p>
<h3>Non-Reporting Resolution</h3>
<p>If a non-reporting resolution is reached, the federal violation disposition is treated similarly to a traffic ticket, resulting in a small fine, and the disposition is not reported to <abbr title="Florida Crime Information Center">FCIC</abbr>, <abbr title="National Crime Information Center">NCIC</abbr>, or Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr>.</p>
<p>Because a non-reporting resolution does not result in a plea and a judgment is not entered by the court, a non-reporting disposition does not qualify as a conviction under state or federal law and a person can truthfully deny they were convicted of a criminal offense.</p>
<h3>Reporting Resolution</h3>
<p>If a reporting resolution is reached or the federal violation notice proceeds to trial, the federal violation is disposed of as a criminal conviction and the disposition is reported to the FCIC, NCIC, and Florida <abbr title="Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles">DHSMV</abbr>.</p>
<p>Because a reporting resolution results in a plea and an adjudication of guilt being entered by the court, a reporting disposition qualifies as a conviction under state and federal law and a person cannot deny they were convicted of a criminal offense.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Federal Violation Notices</h2>
<p>Federal Violation Notices can be defended with the same pretrial defenses and trial defenses that can be raised in any criminal case.</p>
<p>However, the best defense to a federal violation is usually to negotiate a non-reporting disposition that results in a small fine and avoids the entry of any criminal history on a person’s record.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/152">18 U.S.C. § 152</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/157">18 U.S.C. § 157</a>, the federal crime of Bankruptcy Fraud is committed when a person makes a false statement or misleading claim in a bankruptcy proceeding or willfully files a fraudulent bankruptcy petition or document as part of a larger scheme to defraud.</p>
<h3>Bankruptcy Fraud Examples</h3>
<p>Bankruptcy fraud can take on many forms, the most common examples of Bankruptcy Fraud include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concealment of Assets</li>
<li>Depletion of Assets</li>
<li>False Statements in Bankruptcy Filings</li>
<li>Invoking Automatic Stay Provision as Part of Scheme to Defraud</li>
<li>Serial Bankruptcy Law Suits</li>
<li>Sham Bankruptcy Law Suits</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conspiracy to Commit Bankruptcy Fraud</h3>
<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/371">18 U.S.C. § 371</a>, Conspiracy to Commit Bankruptcy Fraud occurs when two or more people conspire to commit Bankruptcy Fraud.</p>
<p>The government often charges minor participants with Conspiracy to Commit Bankruptcy Fraud because under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/371">18 U.S.C. § 371</a>, the penalties for Conspiracy to Commit Bankruptcy Fraud are the same as Bankruptcy Fraud, which results in minor participants cutting deals to testify against major participants in order to avoid the significant penalties Bankruptcy Fraud carries.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Bankruptcy Fraud</h2>
<p>Under federal law, the crime of Bankruptcy Fraud is a Class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and $250,000 in fines. Additionally, the defendant would be required to pay restitution and forfeit any money or property obtained from the scheme to defraud. </p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines/2016-guidelines-manual/2016-chapter-2-c#2b11">United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, §2B1</a>, a person convicted of Bankruptcy Fraud would be assigned a base offense level between 8-36, which carries a guideline range of probation up to 33 months in prison before taking into account any mitigating or aggravating circumstances.</p>
<p>Importantly, probation is rarely given in federal cases and the amount of financial loss or the existence of aggravating offense characteristics associated with a particular Bankruptcy Fraud case can result in a significantly greater prison sentence than 33 months in prison.</p>
<p>As of 2018, the average federal sentence imposed for Bankruptcy Fraud fell between 20-24 months in prison. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Bankruptcy Fraud</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the federal crime of Bankruptcy Fraud include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#good-faith-belief">Good Faith Belief</a></li>
<li><a href="#substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</a></li>
<li><a href="#unlawful-search-and-seizure">Unlawful Search and Seizure</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="good-faith-belief">Good Faith Belief</h3>
<p>It is a defense to the federal crime of Bankruptcy Fraud if a defendant honestly and in good faith believed the deceptive statements or promises made as part of the scheme were true. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>However, a defendant cannot engage in willful blindness by ignoring the truth of the statements. Nor is it a defense if the defendant intends to deceive but feels the victim will ultimately profit or be unharmed.</p>
<h3 id="substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</h3>
<p>While not technically a defense, Substantial Assistance is the most commonly utilized method to avoid the significant penalties Bankruptcy Fraud carries.</p>
<p>The prosecutor is authorized by statute to ask the court to reduce or suspend a sentence of any person who is convicted of Securities fraud when the person provides substantial assistance in the identification, arrest, or conviction of any other person engaged in the scheme to defraud.</p>
<h3 id="unlawful-search-and-seizure">Unlawful Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>Often, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or property searched when they otherwise would not be required to, coerce people into agreeing to a search, arrest people without probable cause, or obtain search warrants in bad faith.</p>
<p>If any of these can be proven through the filing of a <a href="#criminal_defenses_motion_to_suppress">Motion to Suppress</a>, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been unlawfully obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States; which can lead to an outright dismissal of the case or reduced charges.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Federal Cocaine Trafficking</h1>
<blockquote>Federal law imposes mandatory prison sentences for Cocaine Trafficking convictions.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/841">21 U.S.C. §§ 841</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/960">960</a>, the federal crime of Cocaine Trafficking is committed when a person knowingly or intentionally manufactures, distributes, or dispenses 500 grams or more of powder cocaine mixture or 5 grams or more of cocaine base mixture.</p>
<h3>Powder Cocaine vs. Cocaine Base Disparity</h3>
<p>Powder cocaine and cocaine base are both chemical forms of cocaine, but differ in how they are manufactured, ingested, and their effects.</p>
<p>The primary distinguishing factor between the two forms of cocaine is that powder cocaine can only be snorted or dissolved in water and injected, whereas cocaine base can only be smoked. Common forms of cocaine base are freebase, coca paste, and crack cocaine.</p>
<p>Importantly, federal law punishes trafficking in cocaine base 18 times more severely than trafficking in the same quantity of powder cocaine.</p>
<p>The reason for this disparity is because cocaine base is considered to be more psychologically addicting than powder cocaine, more likely to result in chronic and heavy use, and more commonly associated with violent crime.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy to Traffic in Cocaine</h3>
<p>Conspiracy to traffic in cocaine occurs when two or more people work together to manufacture, distribute, or dispense cocaine unlawfully.</p>
<p>Importantly, conspiracy to traffic in cocaine can, and usually is, charged against minor participants such as a driver, a drug mule, or a street dealer connected to a cocaine distribution network.</p>
<p>The government charges minor participants with Conspiracy to Traffic in Cocaine because under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/846">21 U.S.C. § 846</a>, the penalties for Conspiracy to Traffic in Cocaine are the same as actual Cocaine Trafficking, which results in minor participants cutting deals to testify against major participants in order to avoid the enhanced Cocaine Trafficking penalties.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Cocaine Trafficking</h2>
<p>Federal law imposes mandatory minimum prison sentences and large fines on people convicted of Cocaine Trafficking. And unless the United States Attorney General agrees to waive the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements, the penalties for Cocaine Trafficking are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#500-grams">Trafficking in 500-4,999 grams of powder cocaine mixture / 5 to 279 grams of cocaine base mixture</a></li>
<li><a href="#5-kilograms">Trafficking in 5 kilograms or more of powder cocaine mixture / 280 grams or more of cocaine base mixture</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="500-grams">Trafficking in 500-4,999 grams of powder cocaine mixture / 5 to 279 grams of cocaine base mixture</h3>
<p>Under federal law, the crime of trafficking in 500-4,999 grams of powder cocaine mixture or 5 to 279 grams of cocaine base mixture is a Class B felony, punishable by five to forty years in prison to be followed by four years of supervised release and up to five million dollars in fines.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines">United States Sentencing Guidelines</a>, trafficking in 500-4,999 grams of powder cocaine mixture or 5 to 279 grams of cocaine base mixture carries a base offense level between 24-28, but a judge is required to impose a minimum prison sentence of five years in prison, unless the defendant qualifies for the safety valve or the government requests a downward departure.</p>
<h3 id="5-kilograms">Trafficking in 5 kilograms or more of powder cocaine mixture / 280 grams or more of cocaine base mixture</h3>
<p>Under federal law, the crime of trafficking in 5 kilograms or more of powder cocaine mixture or 280 grams or more of cocaine base mixture is a Class A felony, punishable by ten years to life in prison to be followed by five years of supervised release and up to ten million dollars in fines.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines">United States Sentencing Guidelines</a>, trafficking in 500-4,999 grams of powder cocaine mixture or 5 to 279 grams of cocaine base mixture carries a base offense level between 30-38, but a judge is required to impose a minimum prison sentence of ten years in prison, unless the defendant qualifies for the safety valve or the government requests a downward departure.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Cocaine Trafficking</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Cocaine Trafficking include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#entrapment">Entrapment</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="#substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="entrapment">Entrapment</h3>
<p>Entrapment occurs when an undercover law enforcement officer or confidential informant induces a person to commit a criminal offense that the person would otherwise have been unlikely to commit. If it can be shown you were entrapped, the court can dismiss the charges against you.</p>
<h3 id="search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>Often, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search when they otherwise would not be required to; coerce people into agreeing to a search; arrest people without probable cause; or obtain search warrants in bad faith.</p>
<p>If any of these can be proven through the filing of a <a href="#criminal_defenses_motion_to_suppress">Motion to Suppress</a>, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States; which can lead to an outright dismissal of the case.</p>
<h3 id="insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>The prosecutor can only prove you possessed cocaine for the purposes of trafficking in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#actual-possession">Actual Possession</a></li>
<li><a href="#constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</a></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="actual-possession">Actual Possession</h4>
<p>To prove that you actually possessed cocaine, the prosecutor has to show the cocaine was found on your person. So if the cocaine was found in your personally owned car while you were driving, the prosecutor would have a case involving actual possession of cocaine.</p>
<h4 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h4>
<p>On the other hand, if the cocaine was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have a much more difficult time proving you possessed the cocaine because they would have to comply with the law of constructive possession.</p>
<p>The law of constructive possession requires the prosecutor to prove each of three distinct elements before you can be convicted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the cocaine’s presence;</li>
<li>Knowledge the substance was cocaine; and</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the cocaine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it could be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive possession.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found cocaine in the trunk, they would be unable to convict you of Cocaine Trafficking unless they had some proof that you knew the cocaine was there.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found a cocaine package in the back seat, but in plain view. They would be unable to convict you of Cocaine Trafficking unless they had some proof that you knew the package contained cocaine.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend takes a package with cocaine in it and places it in the passenger side door pocket. The police then stop you, see your friend’s package, and arrest both of you. As long as there is not evidence you were working in conjunction with your friend, they would be unable to convict you of Cocaine Trafficking because, even though you knew the cocaine was there, your friend is the only person who had dominion and control over it.</blockquote>
<h3 id="substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</h3>
<p>While not technically a defense, Substantial Assistance is the most commonly utilized method to avoid the minimum-mandatory sentencing required for the crime of Cocaine Trafficking.</p>
<p>The prosecutor is authorized by statute to ask the court to reduce or suspend a sentence of any person who is convicted of drug trafficking when the person provides substantial assistance in the identification, arrest, or conviction of any other person engaged in trafficking in controlled substances.</p>
<p>This remedy is routinely offered pursuant to a “Substantial Assistance Contract” that requires you to “assist” law enforcement in arresting a specific amount of individuals involved in trafficking drugs within a limited period of time.</p>
<p>However, if you are unable to deliver the specified amount of people, you will be required to serve the applicable mandatory minimum prison sentence; regardless of how hard you tried to “assist” law enforcement.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Federal Felon in Possession of a Firearm</h1>
<blockquote>A conviction for Felon in Possession of a Firearm will carry a lengthy prison sentence.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922">18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)</a>, the crime of Felon in Possession of a Firearm is committed when a convicted felon ships, transports, or possesses any firearm or ammunition that has been distributed in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>
<h3>Definition of a Conviction</h3>
<p>Pursuant to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921">18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20)</a>, the existence of a felony conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) is “determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held.”</p>
<p>Florida is one of several states that authorizes a form of deferred judgment called withholding adjudication of guilt. Under Florida law, a person who receives a withhold of adjudication of guilt is not considered to be a convicted felon. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<p>Consequently, a guilty plea for a felony in which adjudication was withheld under Florida law does not qualify as a “conviction” under federal law. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Felon in Possession of a Firearm</h2>
<p>Under federal law, the crime of Felon in Possession of a Firearm is a Class D felony, punishable by up to ten years in prison, three years of supervised release, and $250,000 in fines.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines/2016-guidelines-manual/2016-chapter-2-e-k#NaN">United States Sentencing Guidelines</a>, a person convicted of Felon in Possession of a Firearm would be assigned a base offense level between 12-26, which carries a guideline range of 10-78 months in prison before taking into account any mitigating or aggravating circumstances.</p>
<p>As of 2016, the average federal sentence imposed for Felon in Possession of a Firearm fell between 46-75 months in prison. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<h3>Armed Career Criminals</h3>
<p>The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924">18 U.S.C. 924(e)</a>, mandates a minimum 15-year term of imprisonment for any person convicted of Felon in Possession of a Firearm if the person has three prior state or federal convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses.</p>
<p>A violent felony is defined as any felony that (1) has an element of threat, attempt, or use of physical force against another, (2) involves burglary, arson, or extortion, or (3) constitutes a crime similar to burglary, arson, or extortion.</p>
<p>The Armed Career Criminal Act defines serious drug offenses as any drug offense punishable by imprisonment of 10 years or more.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="civil-rights-restoration">Civil Rights Restoration with Firearm Authority</h3>
<p>A person whose civil rights and firearm authority have been restored cannot be convicted of Felon in Possession of a Firearm under federal law. <small><a href="#references">[4]</a></small></p>
<p>However, while many convicted felons in Florida have had the majority of their Civil Rights restored, including the right to carry a weapon, very few have had their right to possess a firearm restored under Florida law.</p>
<h3 id="search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>Often, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search when they otherwise would not be required to; coerce people into agreeing to a search; arrest people without probable cause; or obtain search warrants in bad faith.</p>
<p>If any of these can be proven through the filing of a <a href="#criminal_defenses_motion_to_suppress">Motion to Suppress</a>, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States; which can lead to an outright dismissal of the case.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found a heroin package in the back seat, but in plain view. They would be unable to convict you of Heroin Trafficking unless they had some proof that you knew the package contained heroin.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> You were driving your car, had a friend with you, and your friend takes a package with heroin in it and places it in the passenger side door pocket. The police then stop you, see your friend’s package, and arrest both of you. As long as there is not evidence you were working in conjunction with your friend, they would be unable to convict you of Heroin Trafficking because, even though you knew the heroin was there, your friend is the only person who had dominion and control over it.</blockquote>
<h3 id="substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</h3>
<p>While not technically a defense, Substantial Assistance is the most commonly utilized method to avoid the minimum-mandatory sentencing required for the crime of Heroin Trafficking.</p>
<p>The prosecutor is authorized by statute to ask the court to reduce or suspend a sentence of any person who is convicted of drug trafficking when the person provides substantial assistance in the identification, arrest, or conviction of any other person engaged in trafficking in controlled substances.</p>
<p>This remedy is routinely offered pursuant to a “Substantial Assistance Contract” that requires you to “assist” law enforcement in arresting a specific amount of individuals involved in trafficking drugs within a limited period of time.</p>
<p>However, if you are unable to deliver the specified amount of people, you will be required to serve the applicable mandatory minimum prison sentence; regardless of how hard you tried to “assist” law enforcement.</p>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Federal Marijuana Trafficking</h1>
<blockquote>Federal law imposes mandatory prison sentences for Marijuana Trafficking convictions.</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/841">21 U.S.C. §§ 841</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/960">960</a>, the federal crime of Marijuana Trafficking is committed when a person knowingly or intentionally manufactures, distributes, or dispenses 1000 kilograms or more of marijuana or 1,000 or more marijuana plants.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy to Traffic in Marijuana</h3>
<p>Conspiracy to traffic in marijuana occurs when two or more people work together to manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana unlawfully.</p>
<p>Importantly, conspiracy to traffic in marijuana can, and usually is, charged against minor participants such as a driver, a drug mule, or a street dealer connected to a marijuana distribution network.</p>
<p>The government charges minor participants with Conspiracy to Traffic in Marijuana because under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/846">21 U.S.C. § 846</a>, the penalties for Conspiracy to Traffic in Marijuana are the same as actual Marijuana Trafficking, which results in minor participants cutting deals to testify against major participants in order to avoid the enhanced Marijuana Trafficking penalties.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Marijuana Trafficking</h2>
<p>Federal law imposes mandatory minimum prison sentences and large fines on people convicted of Marijuana Trafficking. And unless the United States Attorney General agrees to waive the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements, the penalties for Marijuana Trafficking are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#100-kilograms">Trafficking in 100 to 999 kilograms of marijuana or 100 to 999 marijuana plants</a></li>
<li><a href="#1000-kilograms">Trafficking in 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, or 1,000 or more marijuana plants</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="100-kilograms">Trafficking in 100 to 999 kilograms of marijuana, or 100 to 999 marijuana plants</h3>
<p>Under federal law, the crime of trafficking in 100 to 999 kilograms of marijuana or 100 to 999 marijuana plants is a Class B felony, punishable by five to forty years in prison to be followed by four years of supervised release and up to five million dollars in fines.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines">United States Sentencing Guidelines</a>, trafficking in 100 to 999 kilograms of marijuana or 100 to 999 marijuana plants carries a base offense level between 24-28, but a judge is required to impose a minimum prison sentence of five years in prison, unless the defendant qualifies for the safety valve or the government requests a downward departure.</p>
<h3 id="1000-kilograms">Trafficking in 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, or 1,000 or more marijuana plants</h3>
<p>Under federal law, the crime of trafficking in 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, or 1,000 or more marijuana plants is a Class A felony, punishable by ten years to life in prison to be followed by five years of supervised release and up to ten million dollars in fines.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines">United States Sentencing Guidelines</a>, trafficking in 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, or 1,000 or more marijuana plants carries a base offense level between 30-38, but a judge is required to impose a minimum prison sentence of ten years in prison, unless the defendant qualifies for the safety valve or the government requests a downward departure.</p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Marijuana Trafficking</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the crime of Marijuana Trafficking include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#entrapment">Entrapment</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="#substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="entrapment">Entrapment</h3>
<p>Entrapment occurs when an undercover law enforcement officer or confidential informant induces a person to commit a criminal offense that the person would otherwise have been unlikely to commit. If it can be shown you were entrapped, the court can dismiss the charges against you.</p>
<h3 id="search-and-seizure">Illegal Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>Often, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or body search when they otherwise would not be required to; coerce people into agreeing to a search; arrest people without probable cause; or obtain search warrants in bad faith.</p>
<p>If any of these can be proven through the filing of a <a href="#criminal_defenses_motion_to_suppress">Motion to Suppress</a>, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been illegally obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States; which can lead to an outright dismissal of the case.</p>
<h3 id="insufficient-evidence">Insufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>The prosecutor can only prove you possessed marijuana for the purposes of trafficking in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#actual-possession">Actual Possession</a></li>
<li><a href="#constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</a></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="actual-possession">Actual Possession</h4>
<p>To prove that you actually possessed marijuana, the prosecutor has to show the marijuana was found on your person. So if the marijuana was found in your personally owned car while you were driving, the prosecutor would have a case involving actual possession of marijuana.</p>
<h4 id="constructive-possession">Constructive Possession</h4>
<p>On the other hand, if the marijuana was found in a place where more than one person had access, the prosecutor would have a much more difficult time proving you possessed the marijuana because they would have to comply with the law of constructive possession.</p>
<p>The law of constructive possession requires the prosecutor to prove each of three distinct elements before you can be convicted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the marijuana’s presence;</li>
<li>Knowledge the substance was marijuana; and</li>
<li>Dominion and control over the marijuana.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below are scenarios where it could be argued the prosecutor could not meet their burden of proving constructive possession.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found marijuana in the trunk, they would be unable to convict you of Marijuana Trafficking unless they had some proof that you knew the marijuana was there.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You were stopped while driving a friend’s car and police found a marijuana package in the back seat, but in plain view.

The police then stop you, see your friend’s package, and arrest both of you. As long as there is not evidence you were working in conjunction with your friend, they would be unable to convict you of Marijuana Trafficking because, even though you knew the marijuana was there, your friend is the only person who had dominion and control over it.</blockquote>

<h1 itemprop="headline name">Federal Securities Fraud</h1>
<blockquote>A conviction for Securities Fraud will carry a lengthy prison sentence.</blockquote>
<p>Securities Fraud covers a wide range of illegal activities that involve the deception of investors or the manipulation of financial markets. The most commonly prosecuted acts of Securities Fraud include insider trading, broker misrepresentation, stock churning, and Ponzi schemes.</p>
<h2>Definition of Federal Securities Fraud</h2>
<p>Under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Securities Fraud is defined as willfully engaging in deceptive practices intended to manipulate financial markets or induce investors to make financial investment decisions based on deceptive or false information.</p>
<p>“Securities” are broadly defined as any form of investment, such as stocks, bonds, bank notes, commodities, investment contracts, and options.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud</h3>
<p>Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud occurs when two or more people work together to engage in the manipulation of financial markets or fraudulently induce investors to makes financial decisions.</p>
<p>Importantly, Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud can, and usually is, charged against minor participants in securities fraud scheme.</p>
<p>The government charges minor participants with Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud because under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/371">18 U.S.C. § 371</a>, the penalties for Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud are the same as actual Securities Fraud, which results in minor participants cutting deals to testify against major participants in order to avoid the severe penalties Securities Fraud carries.</p>
<h2 id="penalties">Penalties for Securities Fraud</h2>
<p>Under federal law, the crime of Securities Fraud is a Class C felony, punishable by up to twenty years in prison, three years of supervised release, and $5 million in fines. Additionally, disgorgement of any profits will be ordered and any property obtained from the proceeds of the offense can be confiscated. </p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines/2016-guidelines-manual/2016-chapter-2-c#2b11">United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, §2B1</a>, a person convicted of Securities Fraud would be assigned a base offense level between 6-36, which carries a guideline range of probation up to 33 months in prison before taking into account any aggravating or mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p>Importantly, probation is rarely given in federal cases and the amount of loss or aggravating offense characteristics associated with a particular Securities Fraud case can result in a significantly greater prison sentence than 33 months in prison.</p>
<p>As of 2018, the average federal sentence imposed for Securities Fraud fell between 20-24 months in prison. <small><a href="#references">[1]</a></small></p>
<h2 id="defenses">Defenses to Securities Fraud</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#criminal_defenses_pretrial">pretrial defenses</a> and <a href="#criminal_defenses_trial">trial defenses</a> that can be raised in any criminal case, common defenses to the federal crime of Securities Fraud include:</p>

<li><a href="#unlawful-search-and-seizure">Unlawful Search and Seizure</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="good-faith-belief">Good Faith Belief</h3>
<p>It is a defense to the federal crime of Securities Fraud if a defendant honestly and in good faith believed the deceptive statements or promises made as part of the scheme were true. <small><a href="#references">[2]</a></small></p>
<p>However, a defendant cannot engage in willful blindness by ignoring the truth of the statements. Nor is it a defense if the defendant intends to deceive but feels the victim will ultimately profit or be unharmed.</p>
<h3 id="no-knowledge">No Knowledge</h3>
<p>Commonly called the No Knowledge Defense, section 32(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides that “no person shall be subject to imprisonment for the violation of any securities rule or regulation if the person proves to have no knowledge of such securities rule or regulation.”</p>
<p>The No Knowledge Defense is a unique, post conviction, affirmative defense, whereby the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the defendant was unaware of the existence of the SEC rule or regulation that prohibited the illegal conduct constituting the charged Securities Fraud. <small><a href="#references">[3]</a></small></p>
<p>If the No Knowledge Defense is successfully asserted, a court would be required to sentence a defendant to straight probation.</p>
<h3 id="substantial-assistance">Substantial Assistance</h3>
<p>While not technically a defense, Substantial Assistance is the most commonly utilized method to avoid the severe penalties the crime of Securities Fraud carries.</p>
<p>The prosecutor is authorized by statute to ask the court to reduce or suspend a sentence of any person who is convicted of Securities fraud when the person provides substantial assistance in the identification, arrest, or conviction of any other person engaged in the scheme to defraud.</p>
<h3 id="unlawful-search-and-seizure">Unlawful Search and Seizure</h3>
<p>Often, law enforcement exceed the scope of their authority and require people to submit to a vehicle, home, or property searched when they otherwise would not be required to, coerce people into agreeing to a search, arrest people without probable cause, or obtain search warrants in bad faith.</p>
<p>If any of these can be proven through the filing of a <a href="#criminal_defenses_motion_to_suppress">Motion to Suppress</a>, the courts will suppress the resulting evidence as having been unlawfully obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States; which can lead to an outright dismissal of the case or reduced charges.</p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Dating Violence Injunctions and Restraining Orders</h1>
<blockquote class="half">You deserve to live free of fear!</blockquote>
<p itemprop="description">Pursuant to <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2022/784.046">Florida Statute 784.046(2)(b)</a>, any person who is the victim of dating violence, or the parent or legal guardian of a minor child who is the victim of dating violence, may petition for an Injunction for Protection Against Dating Violence.</p>
<p>Dating violence is violence between individuals who have, or have had, a continuing and significant relationship of a romantic or intimate nature. To obtain an Injunction against Dating Violence, the petitioner must prove they:</p>
<ol>
<li>Were a victim of dating violence AND have reasonable cause to believe they are in imminent danger of another act of dating violence being committed against them; or</li>
<li>Have reasonable cause to believe they are in imminent danger of becoming the victim of a future act of dating violence.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are three factors the court considers in determining whether a “dating relationship” exists: </p>
<ol>
<li>That a relationship existed within the past six months;</li>
<li>That the relationship was characterized by the expectation of affection or sexual involvement between the parties; and </li>
<li>That the persons were involved over a continuous basis during the course of the relationship.</li>
</ol>
<p>Importantly, a dating relationship does not exist in circumstances where contact between the parties has been that of a casual acquaintance or ordinary fraternization in a business or social context.</p>
<p>While the standard for issuance of a Dating Violence Injunction is the same as the <a href="#domestic_violence">domestic violence injunction</a>, the available injunctive relief mirrors that in <a href="#repeat_violence">repeat violence cases</a>. Specifically, the court may award injunctions against acts of violence, referrals to appropriate counseling, and enter other orders necessary to protect the petitioner. </p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Domestic Violence Injunctions and Restraining Orders</h1>
<blockquote class="half">You deserve to live free of fear!</blockquote>
<p>Domestic violence injunctions can be obtained against:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any family or household member, or</li>
<li>Any person with whom you residing as a family, or </li>
<li>Any person with whom you have a child in common. </li>
</ol>
<p> Do not live in fear of being a victim, obtain an injunction to protect yourself.</p>
<p>To obtain a temporary Domestic Violence Injunction, the required domestic relationship, as defined above, must be found to exist, and the court must find that there is an immediate and present danger of domestic violence. To prove that there is an immediate and present danger of domestic violence, you must prove you have been a victim of domestic violence or show reasonable cause to believe you are in imminent danger of becoming a victim.</p>
<p>In determining whether an immediate and present danger of domestic violence exists towards you, the Courts take the following factors into account, which are indicators of elevated danger, and thus reasonable belief that you are in imminent danger of becoming a victim.</p>
<ul>
<li>Acts or threats of violence towards petitioner;</li>
<li>Attempts to harm petitioner;</li>
<li>Family members or close associates;</li>
<li>Restraining petitioner from leaving the home or contacting police;</li>
<li>Prior orders of protection;</li>
<li>Injuring or killing a family pet;</li>
<li>Threats to use a gun or knife;</li>
<li>Previous criminal history;</li>
<li>Threats to kidnap or harm petitioner’s children; and</li>
<li>Destruction of personal proper.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the court enters a temporary injunction, the court may also order that the respondent not come within 500 feet (including that the Respondent stay away from the petitioner’s residence, place of employment, school, or other places frequented by the Petitioner); that the Petitioner be given exclusive use of the home; that temporary custody of any minor children be given to the Petitioner; and that the Respondent surrender any firearms.</p>

<h1 itemprop="name">Repeat Violence Injunctions and Restraining Orders</h1>
<blockquote class="half">You deserve to live free of fear!</blockquote>
<p>A person who does not have a “domestic relationship” necessary for a <a href="#domestic_violence">Domestic Violence Injunction</a>, may be eligible to obtain an injunction for protection against repeat violence. </p>
<p>Repeat violence mostly involves employer-employee, co-worker, schoolmate, and roommate relationships along with neighborhood disputes.</p>
<p>Any person who is the victim of repeat violence has standing to file for an injunction against repeat violence</p>
<p>In repeat violence cases, you must plead and prove:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have been the victim of two incidents of violence, or stalking;</li>
<li>One of the incidents of violence or stalking occurred within the past six months;</li>
<li>And it was directed against you or your immediate family.</li>
</ol>
<p>The standard for obtaining an injunction is much different than in <a href="#domestic_violence">domestic violence injunction</a> cases. In domestic violence cases, no acts of violence need have occurred prior to the filing if you have a reasonable fear that domestic violence is imminent. </p>
<p>In repeat violence cases, not only must the violence have already occurred, there must be two acts of violence or stalking in order for an injunction to be warranted. No matter how egregious the violence may be, if it is simply one act the petition will be denied.</p>
<p>If a Repeat Violence Injunction is issued, the court may prohibit the respondent from committing acts of violence against you, ordering the respondent to counseling, and order other relief necessary to protect you.</p>
<p>Finally, firearms may only be required to be surrendered if the court finds it necessary to protect you.</p>
